0		This is a friction less surface and when the block hits the spring, the spring acts as a negative force which decreases the speed and kinetic energy of the moving block. In this situtaion the kinectic energy gets converetd to potential energy hence we can equate 1/2*k*(x^2) with 1/2*m*(v^2). Given mass(m)=400 gms, spring constant(k)=750 and velocity(v)=0.5m/s, the distance(x) the spring moved is 1.2 m.	Using the principle of conservation of mechanical energy, the kinetic energy of the canister before it runs into the spring is equal to the potential energy of the spring when the canister is momentarily stopped by the spring. Thus, (1/2) * m * v^2 = (1/2) * k * d^2. Given m = 0.40 kg, v = 0.5 m/s, k = 750 N/m. Plugging in the known values, (1/2) * 400 * 0.5^2 = (1/2) * 750 * d^2. Simplifying the equation, we get d = 0.011547 m = 1.1547 cm. Rounding off the answer to one decimal place, we get d = 1.2 cm. Thus, the spring is compressed by a distance of 1.2.	For this question, we can use conservation of energy to arrive at our answer. The block will be stopped when the Kinetic Energy of the block is equal to the Potential Energy of the spring. (1/2)*m*(v^2) = (1/2)*k*(d^2) gives us the expression for d = ((m*(v^2))/k)^(1/2) which gives us the answer 0.0115 meters or 1.15 centimeters which can be rounded off to 1.2 centimeters.	In this scenario potential energy will be equal to kinetic energy, so 0.5*k*d^2 = 0.5*m*v^2. Where k is the spring constant, d is the distance the spring has moved, m is the mass of spring and v is the velocity. After simplifying we can see that d^2 = (m/k)*(v^2). d^2 = (0.4/750)*0.5*0.5. d = square root of (1/7500) = 0.0112 m = 1.2 cm. So the distance moved by the spring is 1.12 cm. Ans is 1.12 cm.	To find the distance \( d \) by which the spring is compressed when the canister is momentarily stopped, we can use the conservation of energy principle. The kinetic energy of the canister when it first touches the spring is converted into the potential energy stored in the spring when the canister is stopped.  The kinetic energy (KE) of the canister is given by: \[ KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \]  The potential energy (PE) stored in the spring is given by: \[ PE = \frac{1}{2}kd^2 \]  Setting the kinetic energy equal to the potential energy, we get: \[ \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}kd^2 \]  Now we can solve for \( d \): \[ mv^2 = kd^2 \] \[ d^2 = \frac{mv^2}{k} \] \[ d = \sqrt{\frac{mv^2}{k}} \]  Plugging in the given values: \[ m = 0.40 \, \text{kg} \] \[ v = 0.50 \, \text{m/s} \] \[ k = 750 \, \text{N/m} \]  \[ d = \sqrt{\frac{0.40 \times (0.50)^2}{750}} \] \[ d = \sqrt{\frac{0.40 \times 
1	There is one big shiny cylinder and one large sphere. Overall there are 6 shapes in the image given. If we subtract one big shiny cylinder and one large sphere, we are left with 4 shapes. So, answer is 4.	Among the spheres that are present, only one of them can be categorized as large which is the green one. The purple one is smaller in comparision to the green cylinder.For the shiny objects, there exists two : silver cuboid and golden cylinder. Subtracting one big sphere and one big shiny cylinder from the total number of objects we get 6-2=4.	There are 6 objects in the image. There is one large rubber sphere, which is green in color and situated on the left in the image. Subtracting all large rubber spheres, there are 6 - 1 = 5 objects left. There is one big shiny cylinder, which is gold in color and situated towards the front and on the right in the image. Subtracting all big shiny cylinders, there are 5 - 1 = 4 objects left. Therefore, there are 4 objects left.	There is one large rubber green sphere and one big shiny yellow cylinder. There are a total of six objects initially, and removing these two gives us 4 objects.	There are 2 rubber spheres one is large and one is small. We remove the large sphere. Secondly there are two cylinders. And two shiny objects. But there is only one shiny cylinder. So we remove the shiny cylinder. We had 6 objects, in total we remove 2 objects so we are left with 4 objects. Ans is 4	There are 6 objects in total. Subtracting the large rubber sphere (1 green sphere) and the big shiny cylinder (1 gold cylinder with a shiny surface), we are left with 4 objects.  4
2	In a pentagon, sum of all the interior angles is 540. Hence, by summing up all the interior angles, we get, (x) + (x+20) + (x+5) + (x-5) + (x+10) = 5x + 30 which is equal t 540. Implies 5x = 510. And x = 510/5 = 102.  Angle H = (x-5) = (102-5) = 97. Hence Answer = 97	The interior angles of a 5 angled polygon will be (n-2)*180. In this case n=5, hence the sum of internal angles if 3*180=540. Now summing up the angles in the given figure, we get 5x+30. This value should be equal to 540. So, 5x+30 = 540, therefore x=102. The vertex edge has the angle x-5 which equals to 102-5=97. 	The sum of the interior angles of a polygon is (n - 2) * 180 degrees, where n is the number of sides of the polygon. In the given image, n = 5. Therefore, the sum of the interior angles of the polygon is (5 - 2) * 180 degrees = 540 degrees. Equating this value to the sum of the interior angles given to us, we get x + (x + 20) + (x + 5) + (x - 5) + (x + 10) = 540. Which implies, 5x + 30 = 540. Thus, x = 102. Angle H = x - 5 = 102 - 5 = 97.	The given polygon is a pentagon, the sum of the interior angles of the pentagon would 540 degrees. 5*x + 30 = 540, gives us x = 102 degrees. Since H = x - 5, the answer is 97 degrees.	The figure we have is a pentagon which has 5 sides. The formula of sum of interior angles is (n-2)*180 where n is the number of sides. So the sum should be 3*180 which is 540. If we equate our given angles to this sum then x+x+5+x-5+x+10+x+20 = 540. 5x + 30 = 540. x = 510/5 = 102 . Angle H is x+5 so the angle for H would be 102-5= 97. Ans is (A) 97	To find \( m\angle H \), we need to first determine the value of \( x \) by using the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is \( 540^\circ \).  Adding up all the expressions for the angles given in the pentagon, we have: \[ x + (x + 20) + (x + 5) + (x - 5) + (x + 10) = 540 \]  Combining like terms: \[ 5x + 30 = 540 \]  Subtracting 30 from both sides: \[ 5x = 510 \]  Dividing by 5: \[ x = 102 \]  Now, we can find \( m\angle H \) by substituting \( x \) into the expression for \( H \), which is \( (x - 5)^\circ \): \[ m\angle H = (102 - 5)^\circ \] \[ m\angle H = 97^\circ \]  Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 97.
3	Given CB = 4 and DB=7. Hence DC = DB-CB = 7-4 = 3.  Given D is midpoint of AC. Hence AC = 2*DC = 2*3 = 6	Length of CB=4 and length of DB=7. Therefore length of DC = length of DB - length of CB, 7-4 = 3. Since D is the midpoint of AC therefore, AD=DC. We know the length of DC therefore 2*DC = AC = 2*3 = 6.	DC = DB - CB = 7.0 - 4.0 = 3.0. Since D is the midpoint of AC, AD = DC = 3.0. AC = AD + DC = 3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0. Thus, the length of AC is 6cm.	Given, CB = 4.0 and DB = 7.0, we can conclude DC = 3.0. Since D is the midpoint of AC, the length of AC = 6cm.	If DB is 7 cm and CB is 4 cm then DC is 3 cm. Now if D is the midpoint of AC, then AC = 2*DC, so AC = 3*2= 6cm. Ans is (A) 6 cm.	Since D is the midpoint of AC, AD is equal to DC. Given that DB is 7.0 cm, and CB is 4.0 cm, then DC is 7.0 - 4.0 = 3.0 cm. Therefore, AC, which is twice the length of DC, is 3.0 cm * 2 = 6.0 cm.  The length of AC is (A) 6cm.
4	In the image, hour hand(which is shorter arrow) of clock is at 8 and minute hand(the larger arrow) is at 3. Hence the time is 8:15. In an hour we have 60 minutes, therefore 15 is quarter of 60. Hnce time is quarter after eight. Answer: quarter.	The clock shows the minute hand is at 3, which is 15 minutes past 8. A quarter is 4 parts of a whole. Therefore the first 15 minutes defines the first quarter and hence the answer quarter.	The hour hand is between 8 and 9. The minute hand is at 3, having completed a quarter of its rotation since starting from 12. Therefore, it is quarter after eight.	The time is 8:15 so it is quarter after eight.	The hour hand on the clock points to 8. And the minute hand points to 3. Which means the time is 8:15. As 15 is a quarter of 60. So the time is quarter after eight. As we are already given after in the sentence answer will be quarter. Answer is Quarter 	The minute hand is on the 3, which indicates it is 15 minutes after the hour. The hour hand is just past 8, so it is quarter past eight. The correct option is:  (E) quarter past
5		In the given set of sequences, one can notice that there exists a mirror between such that the letters have the original image and the mirrored version. The letter starts from C and ends till E. The next letter in the series should be F and hence the option E is correct. 	Each object in the sequence consists of a letter of the English alphabet that is placed next to a flipped version of itself. The 3 objects in the original sequence correspond to the letters C, D and E. Thus, the next object that logically follows should be the letter F placed next to a flipped version of iteslf. Of the given options, option E corresponds to such an object. Therefore, the correct option is E.	The pattern seems like a mirror of the alphabets C, D and E. Hence, the next should be the mirror of the alphabet F which is option E.	All objects follow a letter and mirror image letter attached to each other. The first one is for letter C, then for letter D followed by letter E. So logically, the next symbol would be letter F. F attached to it's mirror image is in option (E). Ans is (E)	The sequence appears to be alternating between symbols with curved lines and symbols with straight lines. The first symbol has curves, the second has straight lines and a curve, the third has straight lines, and the fourth has curves. Following this pattern, the next symbol should have straight lines.  Option (E) "≠" is the symbol with straight lines that comes next in the sequence.  Correct option: (E)
6	Number of red things in the image are 1. Number of tiny matte balls = 2(one is red sphere and other is blue sphere). We need to delete these 2 things from overall count. Since we already removed red matte ball in red things, we just need to remove blue matte sphere from matte balls. Hence, in a total of 7 things, after removing 2 things, we are left with 5 things. Hence answer is 5;	Among all the objects, there exists one one red balls. For the tiny matt balls, there exists two: cyan and red. therefore if we remove all red objects and all matt tiny balls, the number of objects left are 7-2=5.	There are 7 objects in the image. There is only 1 red thing, which is a tiny matte ball. Subtracting all red things, there are 7 - 1 = 6 objects left. Of the remaining objects, there is only one tiny matte ball, which is cyan in color. Removing all the remaining tiny matte balls, there are 6 - 1 = 5 objects left. Therefore, there are 5 objects left.	There is one red thing and one tiny matte ball. There are seven objects initially, and removing these two gives us 5 objects.	There is 1 red ball which we subtract in our first subtraction. We are then left with only 1 tiny matte ball which we subtract in our second subtraction. So we remove 2 objects. In total we had 7 objects. We are left with 7-2 = 5 objects. Ans is 5	There are 8 objects in total. Subtracting the red ball, there are 7 objects left. There are no tiny matte balls visible, so no further subtraction is needed. Therefore, 7 objects are left. 7
7	There are 4 blue dots overall, and we divide into 2 equal groups. Groups are shown as circles in the image. Hence each group(each circle) contains 4/2 = 2 dots. Math and image supports this reasoning. So answer is 2	There exists two groups identified via circle boundaries having two dots in each of them as shown in the picture. Therefore, there are 2 dots in each group.	It is given that the model has 4 dots divided into 2 equal groups. Therefore, each group contains 4 / 2 = 2 dots. Thus, there are 2 dots in each group.	Like the question says, there are 4 dots in 2 equal groups. Hence, each group has 4/2 = 2 dots.	Our model has 4 dots. The dots are separated equally by 2 groups. Each group therefore contains 4/2 that is 2 dots. Ans is 2	Since there are 4 dots divided equally into 2 groups, there are 2 dots in each group.   2
8	For both x = 2 and x = 5, f(x) = (2x-3) + 1 = 2x-2. derivatve of f(x) = 2. Hence derivative at both x=2 and x=5 have same derviative, 2. Hence answer is equal to.	Since, both x=2 and x=5 have the same function region which is positive, both of them will have the function definition of 2x-3+1=2x-2. The derivate of this is 2. therefore it is equal for both the points. 	The slope of the function f(x) is the same at x=2 and at x=5. Therfore, the derivative of f(x) at x=2 is equal to that at x=5.	The derivative a x = 2 would be the derivative of f(x) = 2*x - 3 + 1 which is 2. This is the same as the derivative at x = 5. Hence the answer is equal to.	For the given mod function f(x) both 2 and 5 lie in the positive region. So f(x) can be equated to 2x-3. The derivate of which is 2. This is the same for 2 and 5. Ans is equal to	The graph shows a V-shaped function, which is the absolute value function shifted and scaled. The slopes of the lines on either side of the vertex are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. At x=2, the function is decreasing, and at x=5, it is increasing. Therefore, the derivative at x=2 is negative, and the derivative at x=5 is positive. Since a positive number is greater than a negative number, the derivative at x=5 is larger than that at x=2.  (A) larger than
9	Given AC = 8 and BC = 15. and AB is diameter of circle. If one side of a triangle is diameter of a circle, then taht traingle would be a right angle triangle with that side as hypotenues. Hence AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 = 8*8 + 15*15 = 64 + 225 = 289. Implies AB = sqrt(289) = 17. Since AB is diameter, radius of the circle is AB/2 = 17/2 = 8.5	Angle subtended by a diameter on any point of a circle is 90 degree. Therefore, hypotenuse is the diameter AB which is opposite to the 90 degree angle. AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2, where AC=8 inches and BC=15 inches. AC equals to sqaure root of 64+225 = 289, which is 17. Therefore, the radius of the circle is half of AC, 8.5 inches.	Since AB is the diameter, triangle ACB is a right triangle with angle ACB being a right angle. Using Pythagoras' theorem, AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2. Which implies, AB^2 = 8^2 + 15^2 = 289. Thus, AB = sqrt(289) = 17. The radius of the circle is equal to half the length of its diameter AB. Therefore, the radius of the circle is 17 / 2 = 8.5.	ABC is a right angled triangle since each angle projected by the diameter of the circle is 90 degrees. Hence, using the Pythagoras principle, AB = (225+64)^(1/2) which gives us AB = 17. Since AB is the diameter, the radius is equal to half of the diameter which gives us 8.5.	AB is the diameter of the circle. Angle made by 2 points in a diameter and the third point in the circumference is always a right angle that is 90 degree. So therefore in the triangle ABC, AB is the hypotunese. Therefore AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 . As AC is 8 inch and BC is 15 inch so therefore AB which is the diameter is 17 cm. Radius is 17/2 = 8.5 inch. Ans is 8.5	Since \( \overline{AB} \) is a diameter of the circle and \( AC \) and \( BC \) are radii of the circle, triangle \( ABC \) is a right triangle with \( AC \) and \( BC \) as its legs and \( \overline{AB} \) as the hypotenuse. By the Pythagorean theorem:  \( AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2 \)  \( 8^2 + 15^2 = AB^2 \)  \( 64 + 225 = AB^2 \)  \( 289 = AB^2 \)  \( AB = \sqrt{289} \)  \( AB = 17 \) inches  Since \( AB \) is the diameter, the radius \( r \) is half of the diameter:  \( r = \frac{AB}{2} \)  \( r = \frac{17}{2} \)  \( r = 8.5 \) inches  The radius of the circle is 8.5 inches.  Correct answer: (C) 8.5
10	In a circle if 2 lines intersect inside the circle(as AB and CD intersecting at E inside circle), then according to the theorem, angles B = angle D and angle A = angle C. Hence, angle B = 35. and angle CEB = 180-angle CEA = 180-105 - 75. Sum of angles in a traiangle is 180. Hence, angle C = 180 - angle B - angle CEA = 180-35-75 = 180-110 = 70. Hence, answer = 70 	Angles CBA and ADC subtended from the same chord AC should be equal. Therefore, CBA = ADC = 35 degrees. Next, AEB is a straight line and henceforth CEB + CEA =180 degrees. Given that AEC is 105, therefore CEB equals 75. Therefore, CBE + BEC + ECB = 180 degrees (sum of angles of traingle). Given CBE = 35, BEC = 75, therefore ECB is 70.	Since chords AB and CD intersect at E, triangle ADE is similar to triangle CBE. This means angle C is equal to angle A. It is given that angle AEC is 105.0. Since the sum of angles on a straight line is 180 degrees, angle CEA + angle AED = 180. Therefore, angle AED = 75 degrees. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. Thus, angle A + angle D + angle AED = 180. Plugging in the known values, we get angle A + 35 + 75 = 180. Which implies, angle A = 70 degrees. We have established that angle C is equal to angle A. Therefore, angle C = 70 degrees.	Both angle BCE and angle DAE are projected by the same chord BD, hence they will be equal. Angle DAE = 180 - 35 - (180-105) = 70 degrees. Thus, angle C is also equal to 70 degrees.	Angles made by extending the same chord are equal. So angle D = angle B. As we are given that angle D is equal to 35 degree, angle ADC = 35 degree. Also by the property of lines angle AEC + angles BEC = 180. As we are given angle AEC=105 degree So angle BEC = 180-105 = 75 degree. In a triangle sum of interior angles is equal to 180. So angle C = 180-angle B - angle BEC = 180-35-75 = 70 degree. Ans is 70	In a circle, the angle formed by two intersecting chords is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the angle and its vertical angle. Here, ∠AEC and ∠B intersect arcs AC and BD, respectively.  Given ∠AEC = 105°, this is the angle formed by chords AC and CE, which means the arcs AB and CD that they intercept must sum to 2 * ∠AEC = 210°.  Since the circle has 360°, the remaining arcs (AD and BC) must sum to 360° - 210° = 150°. Because these are intercepted by ∠D and ∠C, which are vertical angles, their measures must also sum to 150°.  Given ∠D = 35°, we can find ∠C by subtracting ∠D from the total of the remaining arcs' measures: 150° - 35° = 115°. However, this is the measure of the arc, not the angle ∠C. Since ∠C is an angle formed by the intersecting chords CD and CE, it is equal to half the measure of arc AD (which is 115°).  Therefore, ∠C = 115° / 2 = 57.5°. This is not one of the options provided, which suggests there may be an error in the question or the options. However, the closest option to 57
11	Given sector paper sheet is rolled into cone. So bottom perimeter of the cap is equal to arc length of sector. Arc length is given by (2*pi*r)*theta/360 = (2*pi*6)*120/360 = (2*pi*6)/3 = 4*pi. Hence answer = 4*pi		The bottom perimeter of the paper cap is equal to the arc length corresponding to the sector paper sheet. This is given by the formula (theta / 360) * 2 * π * r, where theta is the central angle and r is the radius. Plugging in the values of theta = 120 and r = 6.0, we get (120 / 360) * 2 * π * 6 = 4 * π. Therefore, the bottom perimeter of the paper cap is 4πcm.	The perimeter would be equal to the circumference of the sector which would be (120/360)*2*pi*6 = 4*pi which is the answer	When we roll a sector to a cone the lines from the center form the height of the cone while the region of circumference in the circle forms the base of the cone. Because of out sector makes an angle of 120 degree, our total base would be 120/360 of the total base circumference. Our radius is 6. So final answer would be 1/3*2*pi*6= Ans is 4 pi cm	The circumference of the full circle is \(2\pi r = 2\pi \times 6.0 = 12\pi\) cm. The sector represents \(120/360 = 1/3\) of the full circle. Therefore, the bottom perimeter of the paper cap, which is the arc length of the sector, is \(1/3\) of the full circle's circumference, which is \(12\pi \times 1/3 = 4\pi\) cm.  Correct answer: (C) 4πcm
12	Function is nto continious since, we can consider an example, at x = 1, value of y is -1. If we make a small change in x, value of y goes to -2 without any intermediate value of y. Hence function is discontinuous and answer is No.	This is a piecewise constant fucntion and is therefore not continuous at every point.	No. The function is discontinuous at every integer value of x.	The function in the diagram is not a continuous function.	No the function is not continuous at each point because at the integer point the value of step function is not continuous. Ans is No	The graph shows a series of disconnected points, which indicates that the function is not continuous. A function is continuous at a point if the limit as it approaches the point from both sides is equal to the function's value at that point. Since there are gaps between the points, the function does not meet this criterion.  The correct answer is: (B) No
13	IN the image, at x = -1, y is 4. But if we consider limit as x approaches -1, this means that x is not -1  but + or - delta of -1. So, graph suggests at x+delta or x-delta, value of y is 3. Hence answer is 3 	g(x) is a continuous function and the limit when x approaches -1 is 3. It is visible from the figure that when 	Assuming every tick mark on the axes of the plot corresponds to a unit length. Suppose we draw a line parallel to the y axis passing through x = -1. Let this line intersect the function at point P. Point P corresponds to the unfilled circle in the image. If we draw a line parallel to the x-axis passing through P, it will intersect the y axis at 3. Thus, the limit as x approaches -1 is 3.	The limit at x = -1 should be 3 as per the given diagram.	We can see that when x approaches -1, the value of the function g(x) will be 3. Ans is 3	The graph shows the function g(x) approaching a value as x approaches -1. The y-value at x = -1 is not defined (indicated by the open circle), but the function approaches a specific y-value as x gets closer to -1 from both sides. Observing the graph, as x approaches -1, g(x) approaches 2.  Therefore, the limit of g(x) as x approaches -1 is 2.
14	We call the funciton is odd if f(-x) = -f(x). Hence f(x) = a^x. f(-x) = a^(-x). As we clearly see, f(-x) = a^(-x) is not equal to -f(x)=-a^x. and f(x) is not equal to f(-x) fo the function to be even. Hence given function is neither even nor odd.	A function f is even if f(−x)=f(x), for all x in the domain of f. A function f is odd if f(−x)=−f(x), for all x in the domain of f. Given function y=a^x, and a>1, a^(-x) = -a^(x). Hence it is an odd function.	Since the given function is not symmetric about the y axis, it is not even. Therefore, the function is odd.	The given function is not an even function since f(x) is not equal to f(-x), hence it must be odd.	For an even function f(x) = f(-x). But if we take -x as an input in the function then a^x will become a^(-x) which is not equal to a^x. So we can see that f(x) is indeed an odd function. Ans is odd	The graph represents the function y = a^x, where a > 1. This function is neither odd nor even because it does not exhibit symmetry about the y-axis (even function) or origin (odd function). The correct answer is not provided in the given choices.  Correct option: None of the above.
15	Number of brown blocks are 1 and number of large blue rubber things are 1 sphere. Total number of things in the image is 9 and if we subtract 2 from these 9 we get 7. Hence answer is 7.	There is 1 brown block. There is 1 large blue thing. Total number of objects are 9. Therefore subtracting 2 from 9 is equal to 7.	There are 9 objects in the image. There is 1 brown block, situated on the left in the image. Subtracting all brown blocks, there are 9 - 1 = 8 objects left. There is 1 large blue rubber thing, which is a partially obscured blue sphere. Subtracting all large blue rubber things, there are 8 - 1 = 7 objects left. Therefore, there are 7 objects left.	There is one brown block and one large blue rubber thing. There are nine objects initially, and removing these two gives us 7 objects.	There is 1 brown block which we subtract in our first subtraction. We then subtract the only blue rubber thing which is a ball in our second subtraction. So we remove 2 objects. In total we had 9. We are left with 7 items. Ans is 7	There is one brown block and no large blue rubber things visible in the image. Subtracting the brown block, there are 9 objects left.
16	Price of oval beads = 2$/kilogram and price of star-shaped beans = 2$/kilogram. IF chase wants to buy 4 kilograms of oval beads, it costs him 2*4 = 8$. and 5 kilograms of star-shaped beans would cost 5*2 = 10 $. Hence, total 8+10 = 18$. There answer is 18.	Chase buys 4kg of oval beads, the cost will be 4*2=8 and for 5kgs of star shaped beads, the cost will 5*2=10. Therefore, total cost is 10+8=18.	The given table shows that oval beads cost $2/kilogram, and star-shaped beads also cost $2/kilogram. Thus, buying 4 kilograms of oval beads and 5 kilograms of star-shaped beads will cost $(4 * 2 + 5 * 2) = $18. Therefore, Chase will spend $18. The answer is thus 18.	To buy 4 kilograms of oval beads, Chase must pay 4*2$ = 8$. To buy 5 kilograms of star-shaped beads, Chase must pay 5*2$ = 10$. This means she spends a total of 18$.	To buy 1kg of oval beads it costs $2. So to buy 4 kg of oval beads it will cost $8. Similarly, to buy 1kg of star-shaped beads it costs $2. So to buy 5 kg of star-shaped beads it will cost $10. Total cost $18. Ans 18	Chase will spend $8 on oval beads (4 kilograms at $2 per kilogram) and $10 on star-shaped beads (5 kilograms at $2 per kilogram). In total, he will spend $18.
17	rate of change between 2 months = (difference between waiting times between 2 months)/ number of months between these 2 months + 1. difference between waiting times of august and september = 14-17 = -3. We are going from august to september, hence we consider waitign time of spetember first and august next. Number of months between august and sepetmerb - number of rows between august and septmeber = 0 . Hence rate of change = (-3)/(0+1) = -3. Hence answer is -3	The rate of change between August and September given the waiting times is negative. This is because there is a decrease in the waiting time so the change is 14-17=-3	Rate of change between August and September = (Waiting time in September) - (Waiting time in August) = 14 - 17 = -3.	The wait time went from 17 to 14 which means the rate change is 14-17 = -3.	Rate of change is initial subtracted by final. So we subtract September's waiting time with August's waiting time. So the rate of change is 14-17 = -3. Ans is -3	To find the rate of change between August and September, subtract the average wait time in September from the average wait time in August and divide by the number of months between them, which is 1 month in this case.  Rate of change = (Wait time in September - Wait time in August) / Number of months Rate of change = (14 minutes - 17 minutes) / 1 month Rate of change = -3 minutes per month  The rate of change between August and September is -3 minutes per month.
18	Total number of rubber balls = 1yellow ball + 1 blue ball = 2. Total number of yellow shiny things = 1 yellow cylinder. Hence out of 9 shapes in total, if we remove 3 shapes, we are left with 6 shapes. Hence answer is 6.	There is 2 rubber balls. There is 1 yellow shiny thing. Total number of objects are 9. Therefore subtracting 3 from 9 is equal to 6.	There are 9 objects in the image. There are 2 rubber balls in the image, with 1 being a tiny partially obscured yellow ball, and 1 being a large cyan ball. Subtracting all rubber balls, there are 9 - 2 = 7 objects left. There is 1 yellow shiny thing in the image, which is a partially obscured tiny cylinder. Subtracting all yellow shiny things, there are 7 - 1 = 6 objects left. Therefore, there are 6 objects left.	There are two rubber balls and one yellow shiny thing. There are nine objects initially, and removing these three gives us 6 objects.	There are 2 rubber balls which we subtract in our first subtraction. We are then left with only 1 shiny yellow object which we subtract in our second subtraction. So we remove 3 objects. In total we had 9 objects. We are left with 9-3= 6 objects. Ans is 6	There are no rubber balls visible in the image. There are two yellow shiny objects (a small cylinder and a small ring). Subtracting these two objects from the total leaves us with 7 objects.  7
19	Given angle TYW = 52. and since TYXW is quadrilateral, sum of all angles in quadrilateral is 360 and angle Y, angle X and angle W = 90. Hence angle T = 90. In triangle TYZ, angle YTZ = 180-angle TZY-angleZYT = 180-90-52 = 38. angle ZTW = 90-angle YTZ = 90-38 = 52. Angle TWZ = 180 - angle ZTW-90 = 180-52-90 = 38. Hence angle 3 is 38 and answer is 38.	The given figure is a rectangle with all the angles measured 90 degrees. WT and XY are parallel lines and alternate interior angles are equal. Using this property the value of angle 3, TWY=WYX=38 degrees.	TWXY is a rectangle, therefore TW and YX are parallel. Hence, angle 3 = angle WYX = 38.	XY and WT are parallel lines hence angle WYX and YWT are alternate angles. By this property of alternate angles, they must be equal. Hence angle 3 is 38 degrees.	Line TW is parallel to YX. So angle WYX = angle 3 by the property of alternate interior angles. Therefore angle 3 = 38 degree. Ans is 38	In the given figure, $m \angle 3$ is the angle at vertex W in triangle WZX. Since WZ is a straight line, the sum of $m \angle 3$ and the 52° angle at vertex Z must equal 180° because they form a linear pair. Therefore, to find $m \angle 3$, subtract 52° from 180°:  $m \angle 3 = 180° - 52° = 128°$.  However, this is not one of the provided options, which suggests there may be a mistake in the reasoning or the question itself. The options given (A) 28, (B) 38, (C) 52, and (D) 62 do not include the correct answer based on the provided diagram and standard geometric principles. Please double-check the question and the options for any discrepancies.
20	Number of big red metallic spheres = 0. and number of big brown matte things = 1. In a total of 7 things, if we remove 1 thing, we are left with 6 things. Hence answer = 6.	There are 0 big red metallic spheres. There is 1 big brown matte thing. Total number of objects are 7. Therefore subtracting 1 from 7 is equal to 6.	There are 7 objects in the image. There are 0 big red metallic spheres. Subtracting all big red metallic spheres, we are still left with 7 objects. There is 1 big brown matte thing, which is a large cube situated near the center of the image. Subtracting all big brown matte things, there are 7 - 1 = 6 objects left. Therefore, there are 6 objects left.	There is no big red metallic spheres and one big brown matte thing. There are seven objects initially, and removing this gives us 6 objects.	There are no big red metallic spheres so we subtract nothing in our first subtraction. We now have 1 big brown matte object which we subtract in our second subtraction. So we remove 1 object. In total we had 7 objects. We are left with 7-1 = 6 objects. Ans is 6	There are no big red metallic spheres to subtract. There is one big brown matte cube. Subtracting this leaves us with 6 objects remaining. 6
21	Given length of line AB to length of line AC = 2:5. Given length of AC = 25. Hence length of AB = (length of AC)*2/5 = 25*2/5 = 10. Hence answer = 10	Ratio of length AB:AC is 2:5. Therefore, AB:BC is 2:3. Since AC is 25, therefore AB equals to 2/5 * 25 =10.	It is given that the ratio of the length of line AB to the length of line AC is 2 : 5. Thus, if AC = 25, then the length of line AB = (2 / 5) * 25 = 10.	Given AB:AC = 2:5. Since AC is 25, AB must be (25*2)/5 = 10.	Ratio of AB:AC is 2:5. We know AC = 25. So AB = (AC/5)*2 = 10. Ans is 10	The ratio of AB to AC is given as 2:5. Since AC is 25, we can set up a proportion where 2 parts correspond to AB and 5 parts correspond to AC. To find the length of one part, we divide the length of AC by 5: 25 ÷ 5 = 5. Since AB is 2 parts, we multiply the length of one part by 2: 5 × 2 = 10. Therefore, the length of AB is 10.  The correct answer is (B) 10.
22	Given is a quadrilateral. length of 4 sides is 1yd, 2yd, 2yd, 1yd. permiter of a quadrilateral = sum of all the lengths of 4 sides = 1yd + 2yd + 2yd + 1yd = 6yd. Hence answer is 6.	Perimeter is the sum of all the sides of the rectangle, which is 2*(length+Breadth). In the figure above, length = 2yd and breadth = 1yd. Therefore, perimeter is 2*(2+1)=6yd.	The perimeter of the rectangle is 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6.	The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all sides which is 2*(length+breadth). This gives us 2*(1+2) = 6.	Perimeter of a rectange is 2*(length + breadth). In the given question length=2 yd  and breadth=1 yd. So perimeter ia 2*(3)= 6 yd. Ans 6	The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding together the lengths of all four sides. For this rectangle, the lengths are 2 yards on the longer sides and 1 yard on the shorter sides. The formula for the perimeter (P) is P = 2(length + width).  Using the given dimensions: P = 2(2 yd + 1 yd) = 2(3 yd) = 6 yd  Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 6 yards.
23	Number of small balls = 1 green shiny ball. Number of blue rubber things = 1 blue cube. In a overall of 4 things in the image, if we remove 2 things, we are left with 2. Hence answer = 2.	There is 1 small ball. There is 1 blue rubber thing. Total number of objects are 4. Therefore subtracting 2 from 4 is equal to 2.	There are 4 objects in the image. There is 1 small ball, which is green in color. Subtracting all small balls, there are 4 - 1 = 3 objects left. There is 1 blue rubber thing, which is a tiny cube. Subtracting all blue rubber things, there are 3 - 1 = 2 objects left. Therefore, there are 2 objects left.	There is one small ball and one blue rubber thing. There are four objects initially, and removing these two gives us 2 objects.	There is 1 small ball which we subtract in our first subtraction. We then have 1 blue rubber thing which is the block which we subtract in our second subtraction. So we remove 2 objects. In total we had 4 objects. We are left with 4-2 = 2 objects. Ans is 2	There are five objects in total. Subtracting the small green ball and the blue rubber ball leaves three objects remaining.   Final value: 3.
24	Chords CD and AB intersect inside circle Hence angle ADC = angle ABC = 26. Since AB is diameter of the circle, angle ACB = 90. In the triangle ABC< angle CAB = 180 - angle ABC - angle ACB = 180-90-26 = 64. Hence answer is 64.	Given, AB is the diameter of the circle and CD chord. Angle subtended by a same chord makes ADC=ABC. Since ADC=26, therefore ABC=26. Since AB is diameter therefore angle subtended by diameter on any on the circle is 90 degrees. To get the angle value of CAB, which is a part of triangle ABC we can actually add the interior angles of the traingle. So the sum of interioir angles, ACB+CBA+BAC = 180 degrees. Angle CAB = 180-26-90=64.	Angle ABC and angle ADC are angles subtended by the chord AC in the same segment. Thus, angle ABC = angle ADC = 26 degrees. Since AB is the diameter, angle ACB = 90 degrees. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. Thus, angle CAB + angle ABC + angle ACB = 180. Plugging in the known values, angle CAB + 26 + 90 = 180. Which implies, angle CAB = 64 degrees. Therefore, the degree of angle CAB is 64 degrees.	Angle CDA is equal to Angle ABC since they are both project by chord AC. Angle ACB is 90 degrees since the angle projected by the diameter is 90 degrees. Thus, CAB = 180 - 90 - 26 = 64 degrees		In a circle, the angle formed by a diameter and a chord is a right angle. Therefore, ∠ADB is 90°. Since ∠ADC is given as 26°, we can find ∠CAB by subtracting ∠ADC from ∠ADB (90° - 26° = 64°). Thus, the degree of ∠CAB is 64°.  Correct answer: (C) 64°
25	Number of red matte cubes = 1. Number of small green metal objects = 0. In a total of 8 shapes, if we remove 1 object, we are left with 7 objects. Hence answer is 7.	There is 1 red matte cube. There is no small green metal object. Total number of objects are 8. Therefore subtracting 1 from 8 is equal to 7.	There are 8 objects in the image. There is 1 red matte cube, located on the left in the image. Subtracting all red matte cubes, there are 8 - 1 = 7 objects left. There are 0 small green metal objects in the image. Thus, subtracting all small green metal objects, we are still left with 7 objects. Therefore, there are 7 objects left.	There is one matte red cube and zero green metal objects. There are eight objects initially, and removing this gives us 7 objects.	There is 1 red matte block which we subtract in our first subtraction. We don't have any small green metal object so we don't subtract anything in our second subtraction. So we remove 1 object. In total we had 8 objects. We are left with 8-1 = 7 objects. Ans is 7	Starting with a total count of objects, we have 7 objects in the image. Subtracting the red matte cube, which is 1, leaves us with 6 objects. There is one small green metal object, which when subtracted leaves us with 5 objects remaining.  Final answer: 5.
26	In the image, function seems to be positive after x = -1. Hence for x = 3, f(x) is positive. Hence answer is yes.	The function is a continuous function and its value at x=3 wich is basically the y value at the point of intersection of x=3 line and the function f is greater than 0. 	Yes. f(3) lies above the x-axis, therefore f(3) > 0.	Yes, f(3) is greater than 0 since the function stays above y=0 after x=-1. Hence, the answer is yes.	By looking at the graph we can see that the function reaches a local minima for some value slightly lower than 3. But the value of local minima is still greater than 0. So we can safely say that f(3)>0. Ans is Yes	The graph shows the value of f(3) as positive since the point at x=3 is above the x-axis.   (A) Yes
27	In the first 2 rows, for each columns, one additional triangular shape immediate right next to the already marked yello traingle is marked yellow. In the third row too, we will have the similar pattern. hence the question mark will be replaced by a octagon with next right traingle marked to be yellow. Hence answer that matches our reasoning is A. Answer is A.	In the given figure sets, there is a trend where the first subfigure starts with a single color, next subfigure continues from the same state and extends to two colors anf finally the third subfigure corresponds to the three colors in continuation to the second figure. The coloring moves clockwise. In the next row the coloring starts but with one step ahead and follows the same process. To fill in the missing figure in the third row, we follow the similar trend where, first subfigure has 1 color, second ahs two and third has three in continuity of the previous figures. therefore the answer is A.	In the image, for every picture that is not in the first column, the picture has one additional colored triangle in the clockwise direction adjacent to the filled triangles in the picture in the previous column. For every picture that is not in the first row, the picture has the same number of filled triangles as in the previous row, but shifted by one place in the clockwise direction. Of the given options, option A satisfies both conditions for the missing picture. Therefore, the correct answer is A.	The answer is A, since the pattern of progression is that the clockwise neighbor gets filled up. Thus, the answer is A.	The way this pattern works is the first image has a starting point which higlights 1 part of the image. The second image takes the first image and highlights an adjacent region in the clockwise direction. Third image does the same with second image and highlights another part clockwise . Answer is A.	The pattern shows an increasing number of shaded segments in each umbrella from left to right and top to bottom. The first umbrella has one shaded segment, the second has two, and so on, adding one shaded segment each time. The missing picture should have eight shaded segments because the umbrella before it has seven. Option (E) shows an umbrella with eight shaded segments.  Correct answer: (E)
28	In the given square, length of each side = 4m. Perimeter of square = sum of lengths of all sides = 4+4+4+4 = 16m. Answer = 16	Perimeter of a sqaure is 4*length. The length is 4m. Therefore, perimeter equals to 4*4=16m.	The perimeter of the square is 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16.	The perimeter of a square is 4*length of side, thus the answer is 4*4 = 16.	The perimeter is the sum of all the sides of object. Perimeter of a square is 4*length of side. Therefore perimeter is 4*4=16. Ans is 16 	The perimeter of a square is the sum of the lengths of all four sides. Since each side of the square is 4 meters, the perimeter is 4 sides multiplied by 4 meters per side.  Perimeter = 4 sides × 4 meters/side = 16 meters.
29	Number of big matte balls = 0 since there are no matte balls. Number of green rubber objects = 1 green cube plus 1 green cylinder = 2. In a total of 9 objects, if we remove 2 objects, we are left with 7 objects. Hence answer is 7.	There is no big matte ball. There are 2 green rubber objects. Total number of objects are 9. Therefore subtracting 2 from 9 is equal to 7.	There are 9 objects in the image. There are 0 big matte balls. Subtracting all big matte balls, there are still 9 objects left. There are 2 green rubber objects, with 1 being a tiny cube near the center of the image, and the other being a tiny cylinder towards the right in the image. Subtracting all green rubber objects, there are 9 - 2 = 7 objects left. Therefore, there are 7 objects left.	There is zero big matte balls and two green rubber objects. There are nine objects initially, and removing these two gives us 7 objects.	There is no big matte balls so we don't subtract anything in our first subtraction. We then subtract the two green rubber objects which are the two blocks in our second subtraction. So we remove 2 objects. In total we had 9. We are left with 7 items. Ans is 7	Starting with all objects, we subtract the big matte balls and then all green rubber objects. There is one big matte ball (the gold one). There are three green objects (two are rubber, and one is matte). Subtracting these from the total leaves us with 4 objects remaining.  Final answer: 4.
30	Perimeter of given rectangle is sum of all the lengths of sides of given rectangle = 6 + 3 + 6 + 3 = 18. Hence answer is 18.	Perimeter is the sum of all the sides of the rectangle, which is 2*(length+Breadth). In the figure above, length = 6ft and breadth = 3ft. Therefore, perimeter is 2*(6+3)=18ft.	The perimeter of the rectangle is 6 + 3 + 6 + 3 = 18.	The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all sides which is 2*(length+breadth). This gives us 2*(3+6) = 18.	Perimeter of a rectange is 2*(length + breadth). In the given question length=6 ft and breadth=3 ft. So perimeter ia 2*(9)= 18 ft. Ans 18	The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding together the lengths of all four sides. For this rectangle, the lengths are 6 feet and 3 feet. The formula for the perimeter (P) is P = 2(length + width). So, P = 2(6 ft + 3 ft) = 2(9 ft) = 18 ft.   The perimeter of the rectangle is 18 feet.
31		To read the following graph one needs to read stem as the prefix and leaf as the the candidates for the following number starting with stem and ending with one of the leaf nodes. So number of blocks that have 36 houses is just 1. 	There is only one leaf having value 6 for the stem having value 3. Therefore, there is 1 block that has exactly 36 houses.	There is one stem for 3, and there is one leaf for 6 which implies there is exactly 1 block with 36 houses.		The stem-and-leaf plot shows the tens digit as the stem and the ones digit as the leaf. The number 36 would be represented by a stem of 3 and a leaf of 6. Looking at the stem of 3, there is a leaf of 6, which indicates that there is one block with exactly 36 houses.  1 block
32		There is a trend that could be noticed in the three set/rows. To make the last figure of every row, one can see that it uses a combination of both first and second figures. It uses the object that is wired and uses the filled object of the second figure. The first figure's wired object becomes the filled obejct for the third figure and the filled object of second figure becomes wired object of the third figure. Following the same pattern to identify the missing object, the wired hexagon becomes the filled object for third figure and filled hexagon of second image becomes the wired object for the third figure. Therefor the right answer is D	From the first two rows, we can infer that the inner shape in the third column corresponds to the outer shape from the first column, and the outer shape in the third column corresponds to the inner shape from the second column. By this reasoning, the image that goes in the third column of the third row would have a hexagon as its inner shape and a hexagon as its outer shape. This corresponds to option D. Therefore, the correct answer is D.	The pattern follows a horizontal progression where the outer shape of the first entry gets colored and added to the center, and the inner shape of the second entry gets to be the outer shape. Hence, option D is the right answer.		The pattern alternates between a hexagon and a circle within a square, with the inner shape having alternating colors of purple and white. The last shape in the sequence should be a circle to maintain the pattern, and it should be white to alternate with the purple circle before it. The correct answer is (C), as it is the only option with a white circle within a square.   Correct option: C.
33		The sum of indices of first and second stack should be equal to 4 and the elements at those indices multiplied. The following index combinations will be chosen to fill the third stack: (row2-stack1*row2-stack2,row3-stack1*row1-stack2,row1-stack1*row3-stack2). Therefore, the resuls are as follows - 5*2,7*3,*4 = 10,21,8	The product of the third row, first column with the first row, second column is 5 * 2 = 10, which is the first row, third column. The product of the second row, first column with the second row, second column is 7 * 3 = 21, which is the second row, third column. The elements that are left are the first row, first column, and the third row, second column. Taking their products, we get 2 * 4 = 8, which should be the value in the third row, third column. Therefore, the missing value is 8.	The logic here uses multiplication between elements of the first column and the second column to get elements in the third column. The middle elements multiply to give 21 as the middle element, the last element of the first column and the first element of the second column give us 10 in the first element of the third column. Hence, we multiply the first element of the first column and the last element of the second column to get 8 as the third element of the third column.	The way this pattern works is you have to multiply a certain number from column 1 to a number in column 2. The row from column 2 will correspond to the row for column 3 outputs. As 5 and 7 are already used we only have 4. So 4*2 =8. Ans is 8.	The pattern in each box seems to be that the bottom number is the product of the top two numbers. For the first box, \(2 \times 7 = 14\), but the number in the bottom is 5, which is the result of subtracting 9 from 14. For the second box, \(2 \times 3 = 6\), and the bottom number is 4, which is 6 minus 2. Following this pattern, for the third box, \(10 \times 21 = 210\), and if we subtract the difference from the previous boxes (9 and 2), we should subtract 7 (since it's the next number in the sequence 9, 2, 7...). Therefore, \(210 - 7 = 203\).  The missing value is 203.
34	Sum of opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral is 180. Given angle ABC = 60. Hence angle ADC = 180-angle ABC = 180-60 = 120. Angle CDE = 180-angle ADC = 180-120  = 60. Hence answer is 60.	Sum of opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral is 180 degrees, Angle ABC + Angle C = 180. Given angle ABC=60 degrees therefore ADC is equal to 120 degrees. Since ADE is a straight line therefore sum of angles ADC and CDE equals 180 degrees. Therefore subtracting 120 from 180 we get 60 which is angle CDE.	Quadrilateral ABCD is inscribed in a circle, thus the opposite angles of ABCD sum to 180 degrees. Therefore, angle ABC + angle ADC = 180. We are given that angle ABC = 60. Therefore, angle ADC = 180 - 60 = 120. The sum of angles on a straight line is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle ADC + angle CDE = 180. Plugging in the value of angle ADC computed earlier, we get angle CDE = 180 - 120 = 60. Therefore, the degree of angle CDE is 60 degrees.	Since, ABCD is a polygon inscribed in a circle, its opposite angles must sum up to 180 degrees. Since, angle ABC is 60 degrees, angle ADC is 120 degrees. Hence, angle CDE = 180 - 120 = 60 degrees since ADE is a straight line.		In a circle, the angle at the center is twice the angle at the circumference when both angles stand on the same arc. Therefore, ∠AOC is twice ∠ABC, so ∠AOC = 2 * 60° = 120°. Since AOC is a straight line, ∠COD = 180° - 120° = 60°. ∠CDE is an exterior angle for triangle COD, so ∠CDE = ∠COD + ∠CDO. Since COD is an isosceles triangle (radii of the circle), ∠CDO = ∠COD. Therefore, ∠CDE = 60° + 60° = 120°. However, this answer is not in the provided options, which suggests there might be an error in the question or the options given.  If we assume that the question meant to ask for the angle ∠CED instead of ∠CDE, then the reasoning would be as follows: ∠CED is the exterior angle of triangle COD, and since ∠COD = 60° (as calculated above), ∠CED would be equal to ∠COD, which is 60°. Therefore, the correct answer would be:  (C) 60°
35				3*pi/2 = 270 degrees. As per the figure, the value of r at 270 degrees is -1.		The graph shows a polar plot, and you're asking for the value of \( r \) when \( \theta = \frac{3\pi}{2} \) (or 270 degrees). At this angle, the plot intersects the origin, which means \( r = 0 \).  Final value: \( r = 0 \)
36	Given area of triangle = 18*pi. If radius of circle is r then area of triangle = pi*r^2 = 18*pi. Hence r^2  = 18. THe square inside rectangle has diagonal passing through the center of the circle(since each angle is 90 in a square and therefore hypoteneus should be diameter of circle). Hence diagonal length of square = 2*r. If length of side of square = a, length of diagoanl is given by a*sqrt(2) = 2*r. hence a = r*sqrt(2) = sqrt(2*r^2) = sqrt(2*18) = sqrt(36) = 6. Therefore, answer = 6.	Area of a circle is pi*r^2. Given, area = 18*pi the radius of the circle is root 18. Since the square is incribed in the circle, the radius of the square is the half the diagonal of square. Using pythagoreas theorem, sum of squares of 2 half diagonals equals to the squared side of the square. Therefore, 2*(root 18)^2 = 36 and therefore side of the square will be root 36, which is 6.	The area of the circle is 18 pi units. Let r be the radius of the circle. Thus, pi * r^2 = 18 pi. This gives us the value of r as sqrt(18). The side of the square can be regarded as the hypotenuse of a right isosceles triangle with the length of the two equal sides equal to the radius of the circle. Let s be the length of the side of the square. Using Pythagoras' theorem, s^2 = r^2 + r^2 = 18 + 18. This gives us s = 6. Therefore, the length of the side of the square is 6.	The area of the circle is 18*pi square units. This means the radius is equal to 3*(2^0.5). The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter = 6*(2^0.5). Hence the side of the square must be 6.	Circle's area is pi*r^2 where r is the radius. If the area is 18 pi then we can say that r = 3 √2. The diameter then would be 6√2. The diameter of the circle is also the diagonal of a square. The diagonal of a square is a√2 where a is the side length of a square. So we can say that the side length of square is 6. Ans 6	The area of the circle is given by \( A = \pi r^2 \), where \( r \) is the radius of the circle. Given that the area is \( 18\pi \), we can set up the equation \( 18\pi = \pi r^2 \) to find the radius. Simplifying, we get \( r^2 = 18 \), so \( r = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2} \).  The diagonal of the square is the diameter of the circle, which is twice the radius. Therefore, the diagonal of the square is \( 2r = 2 \times 3\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2} \).  Since the diagonal \( d \) of a square is related to the side length \( s \) by the equation \( d = s\sqrt{2} \), we can solve for \( s \) as follows: \( s = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{6\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = 6 \).  Therefore, the length of a side of the square is 6 units.  The correct answer is (C) 6.
37						In a square ABCD with an inscribed circle, the diagonals of the square are diameters of the circle and bisect each other at the center O. Therefore, triangle AOD is a right triangle with AO and OD as its legs and AD as its hypotenuse. Since AO = OD (radii of the circle), triangle AOD is also an isosceles right triangle, which means each of the angles at A and D is 45 degrees.  The angle ∠AMK is part of the right triangle AMO, where AM is the radius of the circle and MO is the tangent to the circle at point M. Since the radius is perpendicular to the tangent at the point of tangency, ∠AMO is a right angle (90 degrees).  Now, considering triangle AMK, we have two angles: ∠AMO which is 90 degrees and ∠MAK which is 45 degrees (since it is half of the 90-degree angle at A in the square). To find ∠AMK, we subtract the sum of the other two angles from 180 degrees (the sum of angles in any triangle):  ∠AMK = 180 degrees - ∠AMO - ∠MAK ∠AMK = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 45 degrees ∠AMK = 45 degrees  Therefore, the angle of ∠AMK is 45 degrees.
38	At pretrain loss 1.80, highest acc score, we can seee from the graph is 50 and it is for cyan color. Cyan is RFT U13B. Hence answer is RFT U13B.	Pretained loss is plotted on x axis. To identify which of the models has the highest accuracy, one needs to look at the point of plotted lines along x=1.80 and which is at the top. The model RFTU13B has the maximum accuracy.	The model corresponding to the cyan line has the highest accuracy score when pretrain loss is 1.80. This model corresponds to RFT U13B.	As per the plot, RFT U13B has the highest accuracy of around 49 at a pretrain loss of 1.80. Hence, option G is correct.	We can see the pretrained loss on the x-axis of the graph. When pretrained loss= 1.8, we can see that at the top point in y axis there is a cyan coloured line at near about 50 accuracy. This cyan-coloured line represents the model RFT U13B. Ans is RFT U13B	The model with the highest Acc score when Pretrain Loss is equal to 1.80 is RFT k=100, as indicated by the green line with circular markers on the graph, which is at the highest point among all models at Pretrain Loss 1.80.  Correct option: (D) RFT k=100
39	If quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded then we say it is surplus else we say it's shortage. At price 790, quantity demanded is 5100 and quantity supplied is 14700. Hence quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded. Therefore at 790, it is surplus. Hence answer is surplus.	At price $790, the supply is 19200 but the quantity demanded is 5100. Therefore to identify if its a surplus or ratge we subtract demand from supply and if answer is positive its surplus else shortage. In this case, 19200-5100>0 hence surplus.	From the table, we see that at a price of $790, the quantity demanded is 5100 and the quantity supplied is 14700. Since 14700 > 5100, the quantity supplied is greater than the quantity demanded. Therefore, there is a surplus.	There is a surplus at a price of $790. Since the quantity demanded is less than the quantity supplied, it's a surplus.	If quantity supplied is more than quantity demanded then there is a surplus else there is a shortage. At $790 we can see that quantity supplied is 14700 and quantity demanded is 5100 which clearly tells that there is a surplus. Ans is surplus	At a price of $790, the quantity demanded is 5,100 units, and the quantity supplied is 14,700 units. Since the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, there is a surplus.   Correct answer: (B) surplus
40	Each angle in a square is 90. Hence x + 90 + 2x = 180. Implies, 3x + 90 = 180. Implies, 3x = 90. Implies, x = 90/3 = 30. Hence, answer is 30.	The line l is tangent to the square at point P. A square has an internal angle of 90 degree. This tangent is a straight lline intersecting P and therefore sum of angles on the staright line is 180 degrees. Therefore, x+2x+90= 180 degrees. 3x=90 degrees, x=30 degrees.	The sum of angles on a straight line is 180 degrees. Each internal angle of a square measures 90 degrees. Therefore, x + 90 + 2x = 180. Which implies, x = 30. Therefore, the value of x is 30.	x+2*x+90 = 180 degrees. Thus, 3*x = 90 degrees, which gives us x = 30 degrees.	We will solve this question based on this figure and properties of square and line. Angles of a line sum up to 180. Each interior angle of a square is 90. So we can see that 90+x+2x = 180. 3x = 90.  x = 30. Ans is 30	The angle formed by the tangent at point P and the side of the square is 90 degrees because the tangent to a circle (or any curve) at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. Since a square has all angles equal to 90 degrees, the angle at point P must also be 90 degrees. The angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, if we have x degrees and 2x degrees forming a straight line with the tangent, their sum must be 180 degrees.  The equation is: x + 2x = 180  Combine like terms: 3x = 180  Divide both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 180 / 3 x = 60  The value of x is 60 degrees.
41	Number of yello matte blocks = 1. Number of tiny brown cylinders - 1. In an overall of 7 ibjects, if we subtract 2 objects, we are left with 5 objects. hence answer is 5.	There is 1 yellow matte block. There is 1 tiny brown cylinder. Total number of objects are 7. Therefore subtracting 2 from 7 is equal to 5.	There are 7 objects in the image. There is 1 yellow matte block, which is tiny and located towards the right in the image. Subtracting all yellow matte blocks, there are 7 - 1 = 6 objects left. There is 1 tiny brown cylinder, which is located near the center in the image. Subtracting all tiny brown cylinders, there are 6 - 1 = 5 objects left. Therefore, there are 5 objects left.	There is one yellow matte block and one tiny brown cylinder. There are seven objects initially, and removing this gives us 5 objects.	There is 1 yellow matte block which we subtract in our first subtraction. We then have 1 small brown cylinder which we subtract in our second subtraction. So we remove 2 objects. In total we had 7 objects. We are left with 7-2 = 5 objects. Ans is 5	There are 7 objects in total. Subtracting the 1 yellow matte block and the 1 tiny brown cylinder leaves us with 5 objects.  5
42	Given angle BOC = 50. Since AB and CD intesect at O, angle BOC = angle AOD = 50. Given OD is angular bisector of AOE angle. Hence angle DOE = angle AOD = 50. Hence, angle EOB = 180-angle DOE-angle AOD = 180-50-50 = 80. Hence answer is 80.	Lines AB and CD intersect at point O. Angle AOD is equal to angle E since OD bisects AOE. Angle BOC=50 degrees. Since DOA is opposite angle to BOC, therefore DOA is also equal to 50 degrees and so is DOE. To calculate OB since AB is a straight line, AB= 180 -  AOD - DOE =80 degrees.	Since angle BOC and angle AOD are opposite angles, angle AOD = angle BOC = 50 degrees. It is given that OD bisects angle AOE. Thus, angle DOE = angle AOD = 50 degrees. The sum of angles on one side of a straight line is 180 degrees. Thus, angle AOD + angle DOE + angle EOB = 180. Plugging in the known values, 50 + 50 + angle EOB = 180. Which implies, angle EOB = 80. Therefore, angle EOB is 80 degrees.	Given angle BOC = 50 degrees, angle AOD must also be 50 degrees. Since OD bisects angle AOE, AOE must be twice of AOD = 100 degrees. As a result, angle EOB must be equal to 180 - 100 degrees = 80 degrees.	We can see that angle BOC = angle AOD by proerties of lines and angles. We are also given that OD bisects AOE. Therefore angle AOD=angle DOE. So as angle BOC=50, angle AOD = 50 and angle DOE=50. Angle AOD + Angle DOE + Angle EOB = 180. Therefore Angle EOB = 80. Ans is 80	Since OD bisects ∠AOE, the angles ∠AOD and ∠DOE are equal. Also, lines AB and CD intersect at point O, forming adjacent angles ∠AOC and ∠BOC that add up to 180° because they are on a straight line. Given ∠BOC is 50°, ∠AOC must be 180° - 50° = 130°.  Now, ∠AOC is the sum of ∠AOD and ∠DOC. Since ∠AOD = ∠DOE, we can say that ∠AOC is twice ∠AOD. Therefore, ∠AOD (and ∠DOE) is 130°/2 = 65°.  Finally, ∠EOB is the sum of ∠DOE and ∠BOC. So, ∠EOB = 65° + 50° = 115°. However, this answer is not in the provided choices, which suggests there might be an error in the question or the choices given. If we assume the question meant to ask for ∠EOC instead, then ∠EOC would indeed be 65°, but this is not one of the options provided either.  Please double-check the question, the diagram, and the answer choices. If there is a mistake in the question or the diagram, the correct answer cannot be determined from the given options. If
43	In the second row, sum of 2 triangles is 8. Implies, one triangle value is 4. In the third row, sum of triangle and circle is 7. Hence value of circle is 7-4 = 3. In first row, sum of circle and rectangle is 5. Hence value of rectangle is 5-3 = 2. Hence answer is 2.	Sum of 2 traingles is 8, therefore 1 trainagle equals 4. Substituting  value of traingle in the last problem with circle and traingle value equal to 7, the cost of circle is 3. Now using the value of circle derived from here in the first problem, we get the value of square to be 5-3 = 2	From the second row, the sum of 2 triangles is 8. Therefore, 1 triangle equals 8 / 2 = 4. From the third row, the sum of a circle and a triangle is 7. Since we have computed the value of a triangle as 4, the value of a circle is 7 - 4 = 3. From the first row, the sum of a circle and a square is 5. Since we have computed the value of a circle as 3, the value of a square is 5 - 3 = 2. Therefore, the value of the square in the figure is 2.	Triangle must be equal to 4 from the second equation. Using this value of the triangle we get that circle is equal to 3 from the third equation. Putting this in the first equation, we get find the value of the square to be 2.	We are given that 2 triangles equal to 8. So value of 1 triangle is 4. Triangle + circle = 7. So circle's value is 3. Circle + square =5. Therefore square's value is 2. Ans is 2	To find the value of the square, we need to solve the system of equations given by the shapes.  From the first equation: Circle + Square = 5  From the second equation: Triangle + Triangle = 8 This implies that one Triangle = 8 / 2 = 4  From the third equation: Circle + Triangle = 7 Substituting the value of Triangle (4) into this equation gives us: Circle + 4 = 7 Therefore, Circle = 7 - 4 = 3  Now we can find the value of the Square by substituting the value of Circle into the first equation: 3 + Square = 5 Square = 5 - 3 = 2  The value of the square is 2.
44	In the give figure, the shape is made up of 6 squares. Given each square is area 1. hence area of the shape given = 6*1 = 6. Hence answer is 6.	The shape is a rectangle with a length of 3 units and breadth of 2 units. Area of the rectangle is length*breadth = 3*2 = 6	The shape consists of 6 unit squares. The area of a single unit square is 1 * 1 = 1. Therefore, the area of the shape is 6 * 1 = 6.	There are 6 squares of unit area, hence the area of the figure must be 6.	The area of 1 unit square is 1*1 = 1. There are 6 unit squares so therefore are is 6*1 = 6. Ans is 6	The shape consists of 6 unit squares. Since each unit square has an area of 1 square unit, the total area of the shape is 6 square units.   6

There are 0 purple matte blocks. There is 1 brown block. Total number of objects are 3. Therefore subtracting 1 from 3 is equal to 2.	There are 3 objects in the image. There are 0 small purple matte blocks. Thus, subtracting all small purple matte blocks, there are still 3 objects left. There is 1 block, which is tiny and brown in color. Subtracting all blocks, there are 3 - 1 = 2 objects left. Therefore, there are 2 objects left.	There is zero matte purple block and one block. There are three objects initially, and removing this gives us 2 objects.	There is no small matte purple balls so we don't subtract anything in our first subtraction.

Then, subtract all remaining blocks. After removing all blocks, no objects are left.  Final value: 0.
46	The hour hand(shorter arrow ) points at 6 and minute hand(larger hand) points at 3. Hence, Time is 6:15. In a hour we have 60 minutes. Hence 15 is quarter of 60. Therefore, time is quarter past six. Hence, answer is quarter.	The clock shows the minute hand is at 3, which is 15 minutes past 6. A quarter is 4 parts of a whole. Therefore the first 15 minutes defines the first quarter and hence the answer quarter.	In the image, the hour hand is between 6 and 7, and the minute hand is at 3. The minute hand has traversed a quarter of a circle since its position at 12. Therefore, it is quarter past six.	The time is 6:15 hence the time is quarter past six.	The hour hand on the clock points to 6. And the minute hand points to 3. Which means the time is 6:15. As 15 is a quarter of 60. So the time is quarter past eight. As we are already given past in the sentence answer will be quarter. Answer is Quarter 	The minute hand is on the 6, which indicates 30 minutes past the hour, and the hour hand is between 6 and 7, which means it is half past six. The correct option is:  (A) half

In a total of 10 objects, if we remove 5 objects, we are left with 5 objects. Hence answer is 5.	There are 4 tiny balls. There is 1 green metallic thing. Total number of objects are 10. Therefore subtracting 5 from 10 is equal to 5.	There are 10 objects in the image. There are 4 tiny balls. Subtracting all tiny balls, there are 10 - 4 = 6 objects left. There is 1 green metallic thing, which is a large cylinder. Subtracting all green metallic things, there are 6 - 1 = 5 objects left. Therefore, there are 5 objects left.	There are four tiny balls and one green metallic thing. There are ten objects initially, and removing these five gives us 5 objects.	There are 4 tiny balls which we subtract in our first subtraction. We then have 1 green metallic thing which we subtract in our second subtraction. So we remove 5 objects. In total we had 10 objects. We are left with 10-7 = 5 objects.

In an overall 8 objects , if we remove 3 objects, we are left with 5 objects. Hence answer is 5.	There is 1 big gray matte thing. There are 2 small metallic cylinders. Total number of objects are 8. Therefore subtracting 3 from 8 is equal to 5.	There are 8 objects in the image. There is 1 big gray matte thing, which is a block located towards the right in the image. Subtracting all big gray matte things, there are 8 - 1 = 7 objects left. There are 2 small metallic cylinders, with 1 being purple in color and the other being green in color.

There are eight objects initially, and removing these three gives us 5 objects.	There is 1 big grey matte object which we subtract in our first subtraction. We then have 2 small metallic cylinders which we subtract in our second subtraction. So we remove 3 objects. In total we had 8 objects. We are left with 8-3 = 5 objects.

There are 4 buckets and each bucket has 5 baseballs. Therefore, total number of baseballs equals to 5*4 = 20	There are 4 buckets, each containing 5 baseballs. Therefore, there are 4 * 5 = 20 baseballs.	There are four bins with five balls in each of them. Hence, there are 20 balls in total.	We can count the number of baseballs. Each basket has 5 baseballs. And there are 4 baskets. So the total number of baseballs are 20. Ans is 20	Counting the baseballs in each bucket, there are 5 in the first bucket, 5 in the second bucket, and 4 in the third bucket. Adding them together gives a total of 14 baseballs.  14
50	In the triangle, we observ that MKL triangle is right angled at K. Hence, hypotenuse ^2 = sum of squares of remianing 2 sides. Hence LM^2 = LK^2 + KM^2. Implies, (x+10)^2 = 17^2 + x^2. Implies, (x+10)^2-x^2 = 17^2. Implies, 10*(2x+10) = 289.  Implies, 2x+10 = 28.9 Implies, 2x = 18.9 Implies x = 18.9/2 = 9.45. Hence answer is 9.45	According to the pythagoreas theorem, sum of hypotenuse(ML)^2 = = (MK)^2 +(KL)^2. This can be appllied because L is a right angled traingle right angled at K. Therefore, (x+10)^2 = x^2 + 17^2, x^2 + 20x +100 =x^2 +289, 20x=189. Hence x equals to 9.45.	Since KL is tangent to circle M at K, angle LKM = 90 degrees. Thus, triangle LKM is a right triangle with hypotenuse LM. Using Pythagoras' theorem, LM^2 = KL^2 + KM^2. Plugging in the given values, (x + 10)^2 = 17^2 + x^2. Which implies, x^2 + 20x + 100 = 289 + x^2. Simplifying this equation, we get x = 9.45. Therefore, the value of x is 9.45.	Using Pythagoras theorem, x^2 + 289 = (x+10)^2. Then 20*x = 189 which gives us x = 9.45.	As KL is a tangent we can see that triangle MKL is a right angled triangle. Using pythogoras theorem a^2= b^2 + c^2 where a is the hypotenuse	The triangle MKL is a right triangle because KL is tangent to the circle at point K, and MK is the radius to the point of tangency, which means MK is perpendicular to KL. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the value of x.  The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, MK and KL are the two sides, and ML is the hypotenuse.  The lengths are: MK = x (radius) KL = 10 (tangent) ML = 17 (hypotenuse)  According to the Pythagorean theorem: \( MK^2 + KL^2 = ML^2 \) \( x^2 + 10^2 = 17^2 \) \( x^2 + 100 = 289 \) \( x^2 = 289 - 100 \) \( x^2 = 189 \) \( x = \sqrt{189} \) \( x = 13.75 \) (approximately)  However, this value does not match any of the given options. Let's double-check the calculation:  \( x^2 = 189 \) \( x = \sqrt{189} \) \( x = 13.75 \)  It seems there might be an error in the provided options
51	In the given graph, x values vary from -3 to 4. y values are from 0 to 2. Hence range of y is [0, 2]. Hence answer is [0, 2].	Range of the function is the set of values possible for y. In the given graph, y can take values in the range 0 to 2 where both the values are included. Hence range [0,2]	The value of y lies between 0 and 2. Therefore, the range of this function is [0, 2].	The minimum of the function is 0 and the max is 2, hence the range must be [0,2].	We can see from the graph that the minimum value the function has is 0 and the max value is 2. So the range is [0,2]. Ans is [0,2]	The range of a function is the set of all possible output values (y-values) it can produce. From the graph, the lowest y-value is -3 and the highest y-value is 2. Therefore, the range of the function is from -3 to 2, including both -3 and 2 since they are both reached by the function.  Correct option:  (D) [-3, 4]
52	For the given range of values of x, y values range from -1 to 1. Hence maximum value of y we can obtain is 1. Hence answer is 1.	The maximum value of the function is when the curve is between x=1 and  x=2 the maximum value is y=1.0	This function corresponds to the sin function, and the maximum y value that any of the points take up is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of this function is 1.	The maximum value of the function is 1 at around x = 1.5.	The local maxima of this function from the graph is 1. So we can say that the maximum value this function can achieve is 1. Ans is 1	The graph shows a function with a clear peak, which represents the maximum value of the function. The peak occurs at a y-value of approximately 1. The maximum value of this function is therefore 1.
53	Given angle AOB = 90 and angle COD = 50. Since AB is a chord, O is center, and D is a point on circle, angle ADB = angle AOB/2 = 90/2 = 45. Similarly, CD is chord, O is center and A is on the circle, angle CAD = angle COD/2 = 50/2 = 25. angle PDA = 180-angle ADB = 135. In triangle PAD, angle P = 180-angle PAD-angle PDA = 180-25-135 = 20. Hence answer is 20.		The measure of an angle formed when two secants intersect at a point outside the circle is half the difference of the measures of the wo intercepted arcs. P is the point of intersection of secands AC and BD outside circle O. the difference of the measures of arc AB and arc CD is 90 - 50 = 40 degrees. Therefore, angle P = 40 / 2 = 20 degrees.	Since we know the central angles of arc AB and CD, we can use them to find angle ADB and angle CAD respectively. ADB = 90/2 = 45 degrees. CAD = 50/2 = 25 degrees. Thus, PDA = 135. Thus, angle P = 180 - 135 - 25 = 20 degrees.		The central angle for arc AB is 90°, which means the inscribed angle ∠PCB that intercepts the same arc is half of that, so ∠PCB = 45°. Similarly, the central angle for arc CD is 50°, so the inscribed angle ∠PDC that intercepts the same arc is half of that, so ∠PDC = 25°.  Since ∠PCB and ∠PDC are parts of ∠P, and ∠P is the external angle for triangle PCD, ∠P = ∠PCB + ∠PDC = 45° + 25° = 70°. However, this option is not listed, which suggests there might be an error in the question or the choices provided. Please double-check the question and the choices. If the question and choices are correct as provided, then none of the options (A) 45°, (B) 40°, (C) 25°, or (D) 20° is the correct answer for ∠P based on the given information.
54		A degree in a polynomial function is the greatest exponent of that equation, which determines the most number of solutions that a function could have and the most number of times a function will cross the x-axis when graphed. In the given graph, the graph touches x axis thrice and hence its degree is 3.	The given function corresponds to x^3. Therefore, the degree of this function is 3.	The function has a degree of three.	This is the graph for x^3. Therefore we can say degree is 3. Ans is 3.	The graph represents a cubic function, which is characterized by its S-shaped curve and is indicative of a third-degree polynomial. Therefore, the degree of this function is 3.
55	Rate of change between day d1 and day d2 is given by (amount spent on d2 - amount spent on d1)/(row number of d2 - row number of d1). Given d1 = wednesday and d2 = thursday. amount spent on d2 = 7 and amount spent on d1 = 2. row number of d2 = 3 and row number of d1 = 2. Hence rate of change between wednesday and thursday = (7-2)/(3-2) = 5/1 = 5. Hence answer is 5.	Amount spent on lucnch of wednesday is $2 and amount spent on lunch on thursday is $7 .To identify the rate of change, we subtract 2 from 7 which gives us 5.	According to the table, the amount Manny spent on lunch on Thursday is $7 and the amount that he spent on lunch on Wednesday is $2. Therefore the rate of change between Wednesday and Thursday is 7 - 2 = 5.	From the table, we can see that the rate went from $2 to $7 which means it changed by 5.	Rate of change is initial subtracted by final. So we subtract Thursday's amount spent with Wednesday's amount spent. So the rate of change is $7 - $2 = $5. Ans is 5	The rate of change between Wednesday and Thursday is calculated by subtracting the amount spent on Wednesday from the amount spent on Thursday. So, $7 (Thursday) - $2 (Wednesday) equals a $5 increase per day.   The rate of change is $5 per day.
56	In the first block, the little triangle is directed toward south west. In second block, it is directed towards south east. In third block, it is directed towards North east. Hence in the fourht block it shoudl direct towards North west. And larger side of this triangle is tilted at around 45 degrees in first bloc, and in second it is tilted 135 degrees. In 3rd it is directed in 45 again. Hence in 4th we expect this to be at 135 degrees tilt. Hence the option matching our reasining is option D. Hence answer is D.	According to the given figure, we are rotating the block clockwise. While rotating the lower right corner is fixed and then at every step the block is rotated 180 degrees. So if we follow the similar trend we can get option D as the enxt position in sequence.	In the diagram, the shape is being rotated counter-clockwise by 90 degrees from the top down. The shape that comes next should be a 90 degree counter-clockwise rotation of the third shape from the top. This corresponds to option D. Therefore, the shape that comes next is D.

57	Number of large metal blocks = 1 blue shiny cube. Number of yellow cylinders = 0. In an overall of 7 objects in the image, if we remove 1 object, we are left with 6 objects. Hence answer is 6.	There is 1 large metal block. There is no yellow cylinder. Total number of objects are 7. Therefore subtracting 1 from 7 is equal to 6.	There are 7 objects in the image. There is 1 large metal block, which is blue in color and located towards the center in the image. Subtracting all large metal blocks, there are 7 - 1 = 6 large metal blocks left. There are 0 yellow cylinders in the image. Thus, subtracting all yellow cylinders, we are still left with 6 objects. Therefore, there are 6 objects left.	There is one large metal block and zero yellow cylinders. There are seven objects initially, and removing this gives us 6 objects.	There is 1 big metal block which we subtract in our first subtraction. We don't have any yellow cylinder so we don't subtract anything in our second subtraction. So we remove 1 object. In total we had 7 objects. We are left with 7-1 = 6 objects. Ans is 6	There are 7 objects in total. Subtracting the large metal block (1) and the yellow cylinder (1), there are 5 objects left.   Final value: 5.
58	The initial position of twig seems to be at 0.5 inches of the ruler and end position of the twig is at 3.5 inches of the ruler. Hence length of the twig = 3.5-0.5 = 3. Hence answer is 3.	Given the position of twig, it starts at 0.5 inch and ends at 3.5 inch. Therefore to calculate length, we find the difference between the last point and first point, which is 3.5-0.5 in this case. Total length is 3 inches.	Drawing a perpenticular line from the ends of the twig to the ruler, we can see that the twig starts approximately at the 0.5 inch mark and ends approximately at the 3.5 inch mark. The length of the twig is thus 3.5 - 0.5 = 3 inches. Therefore, the twig is about 3 inches long.	The twig aligns from 0.1 inch to 3.1 inch along the ruler, hence it must be 3 inches long.	The twig is currently starting at 0.5 inch and ending at 3.5 inch. The difference of which is 3 inch. Ans is 3 	The twig extends from the 0 inch mark to just past the 3 inch mark on the ruler. Therefore, the length of the twig to the nearest inch is approximately 3 inches long.
59	To prove a funciton is injective, consider 2 points x1 and x2. If f(x1) = f(x2) this implies x1 = x2. Give f(x) = x^2. f(x1)  = x1^2 and f(x2) = x2^2. if f(x1) = f(x2) then x1^2 = x2^2. Implies, x1 = +x2 or x1 = -x2. Hence there are 2 values of x1. And therefore function is not injective. Hence answer is No.	An injective function is one in which each element of Y is transferred to at most one element of X. Its also called a one to one function. So for every value of x there exist only one y. But the given curve is a parabola and has two x values for a single y value. Therefore not an injective function.	No. For any value of x that is not 0, both -x and +x map to the same value. Therefore, the function is not injective.	No, the given function is not injective since it has 2 values of x mapping to the same y.	A function is injective if the relation is one-to-one. That means for each possible value of y there is only one x. But in the graph we can see that as graph on the negative x axis is the mirror image of positive x axis therefore the function is not injective. Ans is No	The function f(x) = x^2 is not injective because different inputs can produce the same output. For example, f(1) = 1^2 = 1 and f(-1) = (-1)^2 = 1. This shows that the function maps both 1 and -1 to the same value, which violates the definition of an injective function where each element of the domain is mapped to a unique element of the codomain.  (B) No
60	angle AED = angle ACB. angle DAE = angle BAC. Hence  by AA congruency rule, triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC. Hence DE/BC = AD/AB. Given DE = 1.4 and BC = 1.6. BD = 0.55. WE know that AB = AD + BD. HEnce AB/AD = BC/DE. Implies, (AD+BD)/BD = 1.6/1.4. implies, AD/BD = (1.6/1.4)-1 = 1/7. Implies, AD = 1/7(BD). AB = AD+BD = 8/7(BD) = 8/7(0.55) = 	Since both the triangles are right angled therefore by using the logic that triangles having the same angles have similar proportions of lengths, we can devise that AD/DE should be equal to AB/BC. AB can also be written as (AD+DB)/BC. Substituting the vales of AD, DE and DB we get AD/1.4 = (AD+1.6)/0.55. Therefore, the value of AD is 3.89. The length of the ladder is D+DB = 3.89+0.55=4.40.	The foot of the ladder B is away from the wall 1.6. Thus, BC = 1.6. Point D on the ladder is away from the wall 1.4. Thus, DE = 1.4. Let the length of the ladder be x. Triangle ADE and triangle ABC are similar. Therefore, AD / AB = DE / BC. Which implies, (AB - BD) / AB = DE / BC. Since AB is equal to the length of the ladder x, this equation gives us (x - 0.55) / x = 1.4 / 1.6. Which implies, 1.6x - 0.88 = 1.4x. Simplifying this equation, we get x = 4.4. Therefore, the length of the ladder is 4.40.	By similarity of triangles we can say AD:(AD+BD) = DE:BC which gives us AD/(AD+0.55) = 1.4/1.6. This equates to AD = 7*0.55. Hence AD+BD = 8*0.55 = 4.40 which is the length of the ladder.	AD/AB = DE/BC as the triangles are corresponding. Now we know DE is 1.4, BC is 1.6 and BD is 0.55. Let AD be x then AB is x+0.55. (x+0.55)/x = 1.6/1.4. x=3.85. Final length of ladder AD = 3.85+0.55 = 4.4. Ans is 4.4	To find the length of the ladder AB, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABD. We know BD is 0.55 meters and AD (the height of D above the ground) is the difference between the total distance of B from the wall and the distance of D from the wall, which is 1.6 - 1.4 = 0.2 meters.  Using the Pythagorean theorem:  \( AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 \) \( AB^2 = 0.2^2 + 0.55^2 \) \( AB^2 = 0.04 + 0.3025 \) \( AB^2 = 0.3425 \) \( AB = \sqrt{0.3425} \) \( AB = 0.585 \) meters  However, this is the length of AD, not the entire ladder. To find the length of the entire ladder, we need to add the length of DB to AD:  \( AB = AD + DB \) \( AB = 0.585 + 1.6 \) \( AB = 2.185 \) meters  This result does not match any of the options provided, which suggests there might be an error in the calculation or the interpretation of the question.

61	Given ABCD is parallelogram. Implies, AD is parallel to BC. Hence, angle BCE = angle DEC. Ang give CE is angular bisector of angle C. Hence, angle DCE = angle BCE = angle DEC. In triangleDEC, angle DEC = angle DCE. implies DEC triangle is isosceles and hence length of DE = length of DC. Give DE = 3. Hence DC = 3. SInce ABCD is parallelogram DC = AB. Hence AB length = 3. Hence answwer is 3. 	EC bisects BCD, angle BCE= angle ECD. Since the given figure is a parallelogram, gle DEC = angle ECB, alternate interior angle property. Now angle DEC = ECD. A triangle with equal angles   is congruent to itself under (𝐴,𝐵,𝐶)↦(𝐵,𝐴,𝐶), hence |𝐴𝐶|=|𝐵𝐶|. Therefore, using similar principles, DE=DC=3. And since this is a parallelogram, AB=CD=3.	Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AD and BC are parallel. Therefore, angle BCE = angle CED. Since CE bisects angle BCD, angle ECD = angle BCE. Therefore, angle CED = angle ECD. Since angle CED and angle ECD are the internal angles of triangle CDE and are equal, triangle CDE is isosceles, with the opposite sides of angle CED and angle ECD being equal in length. Therefore, CD = DE. Since AB and CD are the opposite sides of parallelogram ABCD, AB = CD. Therefore, AB = DE. We are given that DE = 3. Therefore, the length of AB is 3.	Angle DCE and angle ECB must be equal since they are alternate angles for parallel lines. Since EC bisects BCD, ECD is equal to DEC. Thus DC = DE = 3.0. By property of parallelograms, AB = DC = 3.	ABCD is a parallelogram. In this AB is parallel to CD and AD is parallel to BC. Now due to this, angle DEC = angle BCE and because EC bisects BCD thereforeangle DEC = angle ECD. In a triangle we know if the angles are equal then the corresponding sides are also equal. Therefore CD=3. In a parallelogram opposite sides are equal therefore AB=3. Ans is 3.	In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length. Since CE bisects ∠BCD, triangle BCE is congruent to triangle DEC by ASA (Angle-Side-Angle), because they share side EC, ∠BCD is bisected (so ∠BCE = ∠ECD), and ∠BEC is common to both triangles. Therefore, BE = DE. Given DE = 3.0, BE must also be 3.0. Since AB is parallel to ED and they are both edges of the parallelogram, AB = ED + BE = 3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0.  The length of AB is (D) 6.
62	In the image, we get to know that price of tumeric is 3$ per kg. And if Natalie wants to buy 4.6 kgs of tumeric, total price = 4.6*3 = 13.8$. hence answer is 13.8	1 kg of tumeric costs $3. To calculate cost of 4 kgs of turmeric we multiply 4.6 with 3 and we get 13.8 $	Turmeric costs $3 per kg. 4.6 kg of turmeric costs 4.6 * $3 = $13.8. Therefore, the total cost is 13.8.	Since Natalie buys 4.6 kilograms of turmeric, the cost must be 4.6*3 = 13.8.	The cost of 1 kg of turmeric is $3. So cost of 4.6kg of turmeric will be 4.6*3 = $13.8. Ans is 13.8	To calculate the total cost of the turmeric, multiply the quantity Natalie buys by the price per kilogram. The price of turmeric is $3 per kilogram.  Total cost = Quantity of turmeric * Price per kilogram Total cost = 4.6 kg * $3/kg Total cost = $13.8  The total cost for the turmeric is $13.8.
63	As we observce the pattern, we get to know that, for a column, element in second row - element in first row = element in first row - element in third row. Hence, if the missing value is considered as x, for the third column, 20-15 = 15-x. Implies, x = 15+15-20 = 10. Hence answer is 10.	Every row represensta. multiple of a number. For the first row when 3 is multiplied by 2 we get 6 then 3 with 3 =9 and finally 3*5. Fro the next row similar pattern 4*2=8,4*3=12 and 4*5=20. Similarly, 2*2=4,2*3=6 and 2*5=10. Hence 10.	In the given image, for the first two rows, the sum of the numbers in the first and second columns equals the number in the third column. Following the same logic, the number in the third column of the third row should be 4 + 6 = 10. Therefore, the missing term is 10.	The third column is simply the term of the first two columns, hence the answer is 10.	The pattern here is that the first element of each row is a multiple of 2 with a multiplier, the second element is a multiple of 3 and the third element of 5. We can see that in the final row the multiplier is a 2. So 2*5 = 10. Ans is 10	The pattern in the puzzle involves multiplying the numbers in the first column by 1.5 to get the numbers in the second column, and by 2.5 to get the numbers in the third column. For the number 4 in the first column, 4 x 1.5 = 6 (second column) and 4 x 2.5 should give us the number in the third column. Therefore, 4 x 2.5 = 10. The missing term is 10.
64	Range is defined as maximum value - minimum value. maximum value in the numbe of science articles = 9 and minimum value = 5. Hence range = 9-5 =4. Hence answer is 4.	Kimberly's classmates revealed how many science articles they read. The range is defiend to be a value such that it is a difference between the upper limit and the lower limit.erefore range for the above task is 9(Lorenzo) - 5(Sophia) = 4 	The number of science articles read range from 5 to 9. Therefore, the range of the numbers is 9 - 5 = 4.	The range is difference between the minimun and maximum which is 9-5 = 4.	The range is maximum minus minimum. Maximum here is 9 and minimum 5. So the range is 9-5=4. Ans is 4	The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values. The highest number of science articles read is 9 (Lorenzo) and the lowest is 5 (Sophia). So, the range is 9 - 5 = 4.
65	Since CD is tangent to the circle, angle OCD = 90. Give angle DCB = 40. Hence angle OCB = 50. Since OB = OC = radius of the circle, angle OCB = angle OBC = 50. IN the triangle OCB, angle COB = 180-angleOCB - angle OBC = 180-50-50 = 80. CB is a same chord for triangle OCB and ACB. and O is center of the circle, Hence angle CAB = angle COB/2 = 80/2 = 40. Hence answer is 40.	Since straight line CD and O are tangent to point C therefore OC is perpendicular to CD forming 90 degree angle. Given that DCB is 40 degrees, therefore OCB is 50 degrees. OC=OB since radius of the circle, therefore corresponding angles OCB = OBC (angles opposite to same sides are equal). So for the traingle OCB the angle COB is equal to 180-50-50=80. To identify angle CAB we use the properties of angle subtended by the same chord. Angle subtended at the circle's center is double the angle subtended by the same chord on the perimeter. Therefore, CAB is half of COB, which would be 40 degrees.	CD and circle O are tangent to point C, therefore angle OCD = 90 degrees. Angle DCB + angle OCB = angle OCD. Plugging in the known values, 40 + angle OCB = 90. Which implies, angle OCB = 50 degrees. Since OC and OB are both radii of circle O, OC = OB. Therefore, triangle OCB is isosceles, with the angles opposite to OC and OB being equal in measure. Therefore, angle OBC = angle OCB = 50 degrees. The sum of the internal angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle OCB + angle OBC + angle COB = 180 degrees. Plugging in the known values, 50 + 50 + angle COB = 180. Which implies, angle COB = 80 degrees. The angle subtended by a chord at the centre is twice the angle subtended on the circumference. BC is a chord of circle O with angle COB being the angle subtended by chord BC at the centre O and angle CAB being an angle subtended by chord BC on the circumference at point A. Therefore, angle COB = 2 * angle CAB. Plugging in the known values, 80 = 2 * angle CAB. Which implies, angle CAB = 40 degrees. Therefore, the degree of angle CAB is 40 degrees.	Since CD is a tangent to the circle, angle OCD is equal to 90 degrees. OCB is hence 90 - 40 degrees = 50 degrees. Angle OBC = angle OCB = 50 degrees since OB and OC are both equal. Angle COB is 180-50-50 = 80 degrees. Angle CAB will be 80/2 = 40 degrees since the angle projected by the chord at the circle is half of the angle projected by it at the center.		In a circle, the angle formed by a tangent and a chord through the point of contact is equal to the angle in the alternate segment of the circle. Here, ∠DCB is the angle formed by the tangent CD and the chord CB, and ∠CAB is the angle in the alternate segment. Since ∠DCB is given as 40°, ∠CAB is also 40° by this property.  The correct answer is (A) 40°.
66	In the graoh, we can observe that funciton has it's maximum value of 1. and gradient looks like it's 0 at that maximum value and decreases as we go either side of the funciton. And this maximum value is observed when u1 = 0 and u2 =0. Hence answer is (0, 0).	A local maximum point on a function is a point (x,y) on the graph of the function whose y coordinate is larger than all other y coordinates on the graph at points "close to'' (x,y). Here at position where u1 = 0 and u2 = 0, is the place where the y is greater than 0, which is equal to 1. Hence, u1,u2)=(0,0) is the answer.	The function reaches its local maximum value of 1 at u1 = 0 and u2 = 0. Therefore, the answer is (u1, u2) = (0, 0).	The function reaches its maximum value of 1 at (u1, u2) = (0, 0).	The local maxima is the point where the value of function is higer than the value of function slightly lower or slightly higher than the point. The point is (0,0). Ans is (0,0)	The function reaches its local maximum where the surface is at its highest point. From the given graph, it appears that the highest point on the surface is at the corner where both u1 and u2 are equal to 1. Therefore, the function reaches its local maximum at (u1, u2) = (1, 1).  Correct option: (D) (u1, u2) = (1, 1)
67	For the function to be odd, f(x)=-f(-x). f(x) = 0.5^x = 2^(-x). f(-x) = 0.5^(-x) = 2^(x). Hence 2^(-x) is not equal to -2^(-x). Therefore given funciton is not odd function. Hence answer is No.	A function f is even if f(−x)=f(x), for all x in the domain of f. A function f is odd if f(−x)=−f(x), for all x in the domain of f. Given function y=0.5^x, 0.5^(-x) = 0.5^(x). Hence it is an even function.	No. For g(x) to be an odd function, -g(x) should equal g(-x) for every x. As a counterexample, -g(1) = -0.5^1 = -0.5, whereas g(-1) = 0.5^(-1) = 2. Therefore, -g(1) does not equal g(-1), and hence this is not an odd function.	Since f(-x) is not equal to -f(x) for the given function, it is not an odd function.	In an odd function f(-x) = -f(x). But if we put values and compare this condition does not hold. Ans is No	The function shown is \( g(x) = 0.5^x \), which is an exponential function. An odd function has the property that \( f(-x) = -f(x) \) for all \( x \) in the domain. This function does not satisfy that property because it is not symmetric about the origin; instead, it decreases as \( x \) increases and does not have a reflection symmetry across the y-axis. Therefore, it is not an odd function.  (B) No
68	for x<1, f(x) = x+3. as limit of x reaches 1 fromleft side, limit value would be x+3 at x = 3. which is 1+3 = 4. Hence answer is 4.	f(x) = x+3 if x<1 and f(x)=(x-2)^2 otherwise. Given x approaches from left side it means we have to calculate the left hand limit. Therefore, the value of function would be 1+3=4	f(x) = x + 3 for x < 1. Therefore, the limit of the function as x approaches 1 from the left side is 1 + 3 = 4.	As per the diagram, as x approach 1 from the left, the limit of f(x) must be 4.	When the limit is approached from the left side of 1, our function is f(x) = x+3. So f(x) = 4. Ans is 4	The graph shows two different functions for values of x less than 1 and for x greater than or equal to 1. As x approaches 1 from the left side, the function defined is f(x) = x + 3. Plugging in x = 1 into this function gives f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Therefore, the limit of f(x) as x approaches 1 from the left side is 4.

Finally the the small blocks represent the ones dimension and are 5 in number. Hence the answer is 9335.	The image shows several shapes composed of cubes. There are 9 shapes made of 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000 cubes each, 3 shapes made of 10 * 10 = 100 cubes each, 3 shapes made of 10 cubes each, and 5 shapes made of a single cube each. Therefore, the number shown is 9 * 1000 + 3 * 100 + 3 * 10 + 5 * 1 = 9335.	There are 9 blocks of 10*10*10 elements which equates to 9*1000 = 9000.

70	Given triangle is right angled triangle. In right angled triangle, hypotenuse^2 = sum of square of remianing 2 sides. Hence 15^2 = 9^2 + x^2. implies, x^2 = 15^2-9^2 = 225-81=144. Hence x = 12. 	Since the triangle is right angled, we can apply pythagoreas theorem. 5^2 = 9^2 + x^2, therefore x = 12	The given figure shows a right triangle with hypotenuse of length 15 and the remaining two sides having lengths 9 and x. Using Pythagoras' theorem, 9^2 + x^2 = 15^2. Solving this equation, we get x = 12. Therefore, the answer is 12.	Using Pythagoras theorem, x^2 + 81 = 225. Thus, x = (144)^(0.5). Thus, x = 12.	In this question our figure is a right angled triangle. We can apply pythagoras theorem  a^2 = b^2 + c^2 where a is the hypotenuse. Using this formula we can say that 15^2 = 9^2 + x^2. x=sqrt(225-81). x= sqrt(144). x = 12. Ans is 12.	To find x, we can use the Pythagorean theorem because the triangle is a right triangle (indicated by the square angle). The theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This can be written as:  \( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \)  Where c is the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides. In this case:  \( 15^2 = 9^2 + x^2 \)  \( 225 = 81 + x^2 \)  \( 225 - 81 = x^2 \)  \( 144 = x^2 \)  Taking the square root of both sides gives us:  \( x = 12 \)  Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 12.
71		To read the following graph one needs to read stem as the prefix and leaf as the the candidates for the following number starting with stem and ending with one of the leaf nodes. So number of flocks having atleast 17 birds but not more than 33 is the stem with number 2 and leaf nodes 0,1,4,7 hence the count is 4.	For stem = 1, there is no leaf with value 7 or more. For stem = 2, there are 4 leaves. For stem = 3, there is no leaf with value 3 or less. Therefore, the number of flocks with at least 17 birds but fewer than 33 birds is 0 + 4 + 0 = 4.	There are only four flocks for stem 2 which fit the criteria of being in the range of between 17 and 33. Hence the answer is 4.	The figure provides us with a stem and leaf representation of the question. Each number is broken into 2 parts, the first part to stem and the second part to leaf. We can see from the plot that between 17 and 33 there are 4 flocks. Ans is 4.	To find the number of flocks with at least 17 birds but fewer than 33 birds, we look at the stem and leaf plot for entries from 17 to 32. The relevant entries are:  - 17 (from stem 1, leaf 7) - 20, 21, 24, 27 (from stem 2, leaves 0, 1, 4, 7) - 30, 31 (from stem 3, leaves 0, 1)  Adding these up gives us a total of 7 flocks with at least 17 birds but fewer than 33 birds.  Final value: 7 flocks.

73	Given ABCD is a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Hence angle B = angle D = 55. In triangle BEC, angle C = 180-angle B -angle BEC = 180-55-90 = 35. Hence answer is 35.	Given ABCD is a parallelogram, angle ADC = angle ABC(opposite angles in parallelogram are equal). CE is perpendicular to AB and hence angle CEB = 90 degrees. In the triangle CEB we know angle ABC, CEB therefore angle BCE = 180 - ABC - CEB = 180 - 55 - 90 = 35 degrees.	ABCD is a parallelogram, with angle B opposite to angle D. Therefore, angle B = angle D = 55 degrees. CE is perpendicular to AB. Therefore, angle BEC = 90 degrees. The sum of the internal angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. Thus, angle BCE + angle BEC + angle B = 180. Plugging in the known values, angle BCE + 90 + 55 = 180. Which implies, angle BCE = 35 degrees.	Since angle D is 55, angle B must also be 55 due to the property of a parallelogram. Thus, angle BCE = 180 - 90 - 55 = 35 degrees.		In quadrilateral ABCD, CE is perpendicular to AB, which means ∠CAB is a right angle (90°). Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, in triangle ABC, we have:  ∠CAB (90°) + ∠ACB + ∠ABC = 180°  Given that ∠D is 55° and ABCD is a quadrilateral, the opposite angles are supplementary in a parallelogram. Therefore, ∠ABC is also 55° because ∠D and ∠ABC are opposite angles.  Now we can find ∠ACB:  90° + ∠ACB + 55° = 180° ∠ACB = 180° - 90° - 55° ∠ACB = 35°  Since ∠ACB is 35° and CE is perpendicular to AB, ∠BCE is also 35° because they are adjacent angles that form a straight line with ∠ACB.  Therefore, ∠BCE = 35°.  The correct answer is (B) 35°.
74	Number of cyan rubber cylinders = 2. Number of tiny shiny cubes = 1gold shiny cobe plus 1 green shiny cube. In overall 20 objects in the image give, if we remove 4 objects, we are left with 6 objects. Hence answer is 6.	There are 2 cyan rubber cylinders. There are 2 shiny cubes. Total number of objects are 10. Therefore subtracting 4 from 10 is equal to 6.	There are 10 objects in the image. There are 2 cyan rubber cylinders, with a tiny one on the left, and a large one on the right in the image. Subtracting all cyan rubber cylinders, there are 10 - 2 = 8 objects left. There are 2 tiny shiny cubes, with a yellow one and a partially occluded green one. Subtracting all tiny shiny cubes, there are 8 - 2 = 6 objects left. Therefore, there are 6 objects left.	There are two cyan rubber cylinders and two tiny shiny cubes. There are ten objects initially, and removing these four gives us 6 objects.	There are 2 cyan rubber cylinders which we subtract in our first subtraction. We then subtract 2 shiny cubes. So we remove 4 objects. In total we had 10 objects. We are left with 10-4 = 6 objects. Ans is 6	There are two cyan rubber cylinders and one tiny shiny cube in the image. Subtracting these from the total count of objects leaves us with 7 objects.  Final value: 7.
75	In each row, third shape is obtained by subtracting 2nd column with 1st column. Hence third row also follows the same pattern, after subtracting 2column of third row with 1st column of third row, we are left with arro pointing North west. hence B matches our reasoning. Therefore answer is B.	In the first row, the arrow faces up then it turns into double headed arrow and then the arrow faces downward. For the second row, right side of the mail symbol is visible then it turns to a complete symbol and then the opposite side of the first side is visible. In the third row the arrow faces downward the gets completed and in the missing figure according to the pattern identified should be facing upwards/opposite direction of the first figure. HEnce option 	In the first two rows, the shapes in the first and third columns combine to form the shape in the second column. By the same logic, for the third row, the missing shape should combine with the shape in the first column to form the shape in the second column. The missing shape corresponds to option B. Therefore, the answer is B.	The third column is essentially the subtraction of the first column from the second column. This gives us B as the correct choice.	In this we can see that the pattern is that there are 3 objects, left, middle and right. The middle is a combination of left and right objects. So by this logic we can see that the answer is pattern B. Ans is B  	The missing shape is a square with two diagonals crossing each other. Option (F) matches this description.  Correct option: F.
76	f(x) is 0 at three points, which are at x=-4, x=-1 and x=2. Among these three values, highest value is 2. Hence biggest zero of f(x) is at x = 2. Hence answer is 2.	To calculate zero of a function, the first task is to make f(x)=0. In the given question, f(x) = (x^3 + 3x^2 - 6x - 8)/4. To identify biggest zero, we calculate x^3 + 3x^2 - 6x - 8=0. And from the graph we can see the biggest zero is 2, therefore solving for the same provides the same zero.	The function is zero for three values of x: -4, -1, and 2. The biggest of these is 2. Therefore, the biggest zero of this function is 2.	The biggest zero of the given function is recorded at x = 2 as per the given graph.	By the plot of this equation we can see that there are 3 zeros of this function -4, -1 and 2. The biggest of these is 2. Ans is 2	The biggest zero of the function, which is the largest x-intercept on the graph, appears to be at x = 2. 2
77	In Hue-saturation model, saturation is represented by distance from the center of the circle. So the closer one to the circle is B. Hence B has smallest saturation coefficient. Answer is B		The closer a color is to the center of the circle, the smaller is its saturation coefficient. Of the given colors, color B is closest to the center. Therefore, color B has the smallest saturation coefficient.	B is the closest from the center and is hence the least saturated out of the three. Hence is must have the smallest saturation coefficient.		In a Hue-Saturation subspace represented as a circle, saturation increases as you move from the center to the edge. The color with the smallest saturation coefficient is the one closest to the center of the circle. In Fig. Q2, point (e) is closest to the center, indicating it has the smallest saturation coefficient.  (C) (e)
78	In the given graph f(-1) seems to be between -1 and -0.5 and f(0) seems to be 0. Hence value of f(-1) is smaller than f(0). Hence answer is smaller than.	The value of f(-1) < -0.5 and value at f(0) is closer to 0. erefore f(-1) is smaller than f(0).	The function is strictly increasing between x = -1 and x = 0. Therefore, f(-1) is smaller than f(0).	f(-1) is smaller the f(0) since f(-1) is less than -0.5 while f(0) is approximately 0.	From the function plot we can see that the value of f(x) at -1 is smaller than at 0. Ans is smaller than	The value of the function f at x = -1 is lower than the value of the function at x = 0, as seen on the graph where the y-coordinate at x = -1 is below the y-coordinate at x = 0.  (C) smaller than
79	Number of cinnamon rolls in the left plate = 10 and number of rolls in right plate = 10. hence total number of cinnamon rolls = 10 + 10 = 20	There are 10 cinnamon rolls in one plate. There are total 2 such plates. Therefore, total number of rolls will be 2*10 =20	There are 2 plates with 10 cinnamon rolls each. Therefore, there are 2 * 10 = 20 cinnamon rolls.	There are two plates of 10 cinnamon rolls, hence there are a 20 cinnamon rolls in total.	Counting the number of cinnamons we can see that there are 2 plates of cinnamons. And each has 10 cinnamons. So there are total 20 cinnamons. Ans is 20	Counting the cinnamon rolls on both plates, there are 9 on the left plate and 9 on the right plate. Therefore, the total number of cinnamon rolls is 18.
80	Since given triangle is equilateral, all the sides have equal length. Implies, 2x+1 = 4x. Implies 2x = 1. Hence x = 1/2. length os side RS = 2x+1 = 2*(1/2)+1 = 1+1 = 2. Hence answer is 2.	Since QRS triangle is equilateral, therefore all the sides are equal. In order to calculate x lets choose these two sides.  4x = 6x-1, x=0.5. Therefore length of the side will be 4(0.5) = 2	If triangle QRS is an equilateral triangle, QR = RS = QS. Consider QR = RS. Plugging in the given values, 4x = 2x + 1. Solving for x, we get x = 0.5. Therefore, RS = 2x + 1 = 2.	Since the given triangle is an equilateral triangle, 4*x = 2*x + 1. Thus, x = 0.5. Thus, side RS = 2*(0.5) + 1 = 2.	Because our triangle is equilateral we can say that sides RQ = RS. 4x=2x+1. 2x=1 . So therefore RS is 1+1=2. Ans is 2	In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal. Therefore, we can set the expressions for the sides equal to each other to find the value of \( x \):  \( 4x = 2x + 1 \)  Solving for \( x \), we get:  \( 4x - 2x = 1 \) \( 2x = 1 \) \( x = \frac{1}{2} \)  Now, we can find the length of side \( RS \) by substituting \( x \) into the expression for \( RS \):  \( RS = 6x - 1 \) \( RS = 6(\frac{1}{2}) - 1 \) \( RS = 3 - 1 \) \( RS = 2 \)  Therefore, the length of side \( RS \) is 2.  Correct answer: (D) 2
81	Number of tiny brown cylinders = 1. Number of tiny brown objects = 1 tiny brown cylinder + 1 tiny brown sphere. Since  1 tiny brown cylinder is already included in tiny brown cylinders, we need to remove  1 tiny brown cylinder and 1 tiny brown sphere in total. So, in a total of 8 objects, if we remove 2 objects, we are left with 6. hence asnwer = 6.	There are no tiny brown cylinders. There are 2 tiny brown objects. Total number of objects are 8. Therefore subtracting 2 from 8 is equal to 6.	There are 8 objects in the image. There are 0 tiny brown cylinders in the image. Therefore, subtracting all tiny brown cylinders, there are still 8 objects left. There are 2 tiny brown objects, with one being a cube and the other a sphere. Subtracting all tiny brown objects, there are 8 - 2 = 6 objects left. Therefore, there are 6 objects left.	There are zero tiny brown cylinders and two tiny brown objects. There are eight objects initially, and removing these two gives us 6 objects.	There are no tiny brown cylinders so we don't subtract anything in our first subtraction. We then subtract 2 tiny brown objects which are a cube and a sphere. So we remove 2 objects. In total we had 8 objects. We are left with 8-2 = 6 objects. Ans is 6	There are 8 objects in total. Subtracting the tiny brown cylinder (1 object) and then subtracting all tiny brown objects (which includes the previously subtracted cylinder, so no additional subtraction), leaves us with 7 objects.  7
82	In each row, shape inside is same. and while traversing each row, outside shapes are rotated among circle, quadrilateral and triangle. So the second row has square as inside shape and thrid row has inverse triangle as insider shapes. and 2nd row 1st column's outer shape would be triangle. thrid row 1st column's outer shape would be quadrilateral and third row third column has outer shape circle. Option matching all these 3 shapes is C. Hence asnwer is C.	There are three shapes used in this question: circle, quadrilateral and a trainagle. Each object has another shape in it (star,square and inverted trainagle). Given the matrix one can observe that all the combinations are present for a particular shape with respect to the shape that is inside. So for example circle will have star, square and inverted traingle and similarly for others. So the figures missing are those whose combinations have yet not been placed in the matrix. Hence option C is the answer.	Each row in the image contains an object with the same inner shape, and a circle, diamond or triangle as the outer shape, with the outer shape not being repeated in the row. Thus the missing object in the second row should have a square as the inner shape with a triangle as the outer shape, and the missing objects in the third row should have an inverted triangle as the inner shape and a circle and a diamond as the outer shapes. Each of the three missing shapes are present in option C. Therefore, the correct answer is C.	The pattern being followed in the given puzzle is that the central object remains the same across the row. The columns follow the outer shape pattern of square, circle and triangle. Based on this, we can conclude that option C provides the correct shapes.	The pattern here is that every shape needs to come inside every other shape. So therefore if there are 3 shapes, there will be 9 combinations. So we can see that an inverted triangle inside a circle, an inverted triangle inside a square and a square inside a triangle is left. Ans is C	The pattern alternates between solid and hollow shapes and rotates each shape 90 degrees clockwise with each step. The correct option must have a hollow triangle rotated 90 degrees clockwise from the position in the bottom left square. Option (C) is the correct answer, as it shows a hollow triangle rotated correctly.  Correct option: C
83	Number of brown cubes = 1 shiny brown cube. Number of grey cylinders = 1. In a total of 6 objects, if we remove 2 objects, we are left with 4 objects. Hence answer = 4.	There is 1 brown cube. There is 1 gray cylinder. Total number of objects are 6. Therefore subtracting 2 from 6 is equal to 4.	There are 6 objects in the image. There is 1 brown cube, which is tiny and shiny. Subtracting all brown cubes, there are 6 - 1 = 5 objects left. There is 1 gray cylinder, which is tiny and partially hidden. Subtracting all gray cylinders, there are 5 - 1 = 4 objects left. Therefore, there are 4 objects left.	There is one brown cube and one gray cylinder. There are six objects initially, and removing these two gives us 4 objects.	There is 1 brown cube which we subtract in our first subtraction. We then subtract a gray cylinder. So we remove 2 objects. In total we had 6 objects. We are left with 6-2 = 4 objects. Ans is 4	There are 6 objects in total. Subtracting 1 brown cube and 1 gray cylinder leaves 4 objects remaining.  4
84					If axis were shifted in the first graph taking z=1-r. Then we won't reach the second graph as it'll be sort of an inverse image where the x=-y line 135 degree from x axis will starting from 0. Therefore answer is false. Ans is False	The intensity mapping function $T: z=1-r$ would invert the gray levels of the image, mapping the darkest gray levels to the lightest and vice versa. Given that the probability density function (PDF) $p_r(r)$ in Fig Q1a is a decreasing linear function and the specified PDF $p_z(z)$ in Fig Q1b is an increasing linear function, applying the mapping function $T: z=1-r$ would indeed transform the original histogram into the specified one. Therefore, the intensity mapping function can be used to achieve the goal.  Correct option: (A) True
85		Angle of incidence is equal to angle of reflection and AC and BD are perpendicular to CD. So by using the properties of similar triangles we can say that AC/CE = BD/ED. Replacing the values of AC, CD and BD we get 3/(10-ED) = 6/ED. Therefore, ED is equal to 20/3.	The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Angle AEC = 90 - alpha. Similarly, angle BED = 90 - alpha. AC is parpendicular to CD. Therefore, angle ACE = 90. Similarly, BD is perpendicular to CD. Therefore, angle BDE = 90. Angle AEC = angle BED, and angle ACE = angle BDE. Therefore, triangle ACE is similar to triangle BDE. Hence, CE : ED = AC : BD. Which implies, CE : ED = 3 : 6 = 1 : 2. Which implies, CE = ED / 2. CD = CE + ED. Plugging in the known values, 10 = ED + (ED / 2). Solving for ED, we get ED = 20 / 3. Therefore, the length of the line segment ED is frac{20}{3}.	Triangle ACE and BDE are similar hence their sides will be proportional. AC:BD = CE:ED. Which gives us 3:6 = (10-ED):ED. This gives us 3*ED = 20, this ED = 20/3.	In physics angle of incidence is equal to angle of reflection. So both will be equal to alpha. Now as E is the foot of the perpendicular on plane mirror CD, therefore angle AEC = angle BED = 90 - alpha. As both these angles are same, and both triangles ACE and BDE are right angled therefore we can say both the triangles are similar. So ratio of sides BD/AC = DE/CE. If ED=x then CE= 10-x . 6/3 = x/(10-x). 3x=20. x=20/3. Ans is 20/3 	To solve for the length of the line segment ED, we can use the properties of plane mirrors and the law of reflection, which states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Since AC and BD are perpendicular to the mirror and AC = 3.0, BD = 6.0, by the law of reflection, triangle AEC is congruent to triangle DEB. Therefore, EC = EB.  Since CD = 10.0, and AC = 3.0, we can find EC by subtracting AC from CD, which gives us EC = CD - AC = 10.0 - 3.0 = 7.0.  Now, since EC = EB, then EB is also 7.0. To find ED, we subtract EC from BD: ED = BD - EC = 6.0 - 7.0 = -1.0. However, the length cannot be negative, and this result indicates that we made a mistake in our calculation. The correct approach is to add EC to the length of AC to get the length of ED, since EB and EC are on opposite sides of E.  So, ED = EC + AC = 7.0 + 3.0 = 10.0.  However, none of the options match this result. Let's re-evaluate the problem:  Since AC = 3.0 and BD = 6.0, and triangles AEC and DEB are
86		Given figures represent numbers and their dimensions. The 3D cubes represent the thousand digit and are total 9 in number. The next comes 2D layers which represent the hundreds digit and are total 0 in number. The single array 1D represents tens digit and are total 1 in number. Finally the the small blocks represent the ones dimension and are 5 in number. Hence the answer is 9015.	The image shows several shapes composed of cubes. There are 9 shapes made of 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000 cubes each, 1 shape made of 10 cubes each, and 5 shapes made of a single cube each. Therefore, the number shown is 9 * 1000 + 1 * 10 + 5 * 1 = 9015.	There are 9 blocks of 10*10*10 elements which equates to 9*1000 = 9000. There is 1 column of 10 elements which equates to 10. There are 5 individual elements. This sums up to 9015.	Here we can see that firstly there are 9 3-dimensional objects. Then there are 0 2-dimensional objects. Then there is 1 1-dimensional object. Finally there are 5 single blocks. So the number is 9015. Ans is 9015.	The image shows seven cubes, each composed of smaller cubes. To determine the number shown, we count the smaller cubes in each larger cube. The first cube has 10 smaller cubes along one edge, so it has \(10 \times 10 \times 10 = 1000\) smaller cubes. Since there are seven such large cubes, the total number of smaller cubes is \(7 \times 1000 = 7000\).  The number shown is 7000.
87	There are 6 values of A-847. out of which 3 values are more than 20 which are 21.8 for OpenSeg[28], 25.4 for OpenSeg[28] w/L. Narr and 33.4 for FC-CLIP(ours). Hence answer = 3.	From the graph, it is clearly visible that only OpenSeg[28], OpenSeg[28]w/L.arr and FC-CLIP have A-847 scores higher than 20. Hence 3	3 values in the column corresponding to A-847 have values higher than 20.0, which are 21.8, 25.4 and 33.4. Therefore, there are 3 methods in the table achieving an A-847 score higher than 20.0.	There are 3 methods in the table which achieve an A-847 score of more than 20.	From the table provided we can see that there are 3 methods. Open Seg, Open Seg w/L Narr and FE-CLIP. Ans is 3.	Three methods in the table achieve an A-847 score higher than 20.0.
88	The nail initial point is closer to ruler's 0.75 position and end point is closer to 2.75 position. Hence length od nail = 2.75-0.75 = 2. Therefore, answer = 2	Given the position of nail, it starts at around 1 inch and ends at 3 inch. Therefore to calculate length, we find the difference between the last point and first point, which is 3 - 1 in this case. Total length is 2 inches.	If the ruler is moved such that the 0 inch mark of the ruler is at the left end of the nail, the right end of the nail would be at the 2 inch mark. Therefore, the nail is about 2 inches long.	The nail aligns from 0.75 inch to 2.75 inch along the ruler, hence it must be 2 inches long.	Currently the ruler starts at somewhere less than 1 and ends at somewhere less than 3, We can move the ruler a little further so that it starts from 1 and ends at 3. The length of the ruler is 2. Ans is 2.	To measure the length of the nail, align the base of the nail with the 0-inch mark on the ruler. The tip of the nail extends to the nearest inch mark. In the provided image, the nail's length is approximately 3 inches long.
89	Given DCF = 20,Hence angle DOF would be 40 since DF is chord. Ang given G is midpoint of EF. Triangle EOG is similar to triangle FOG. and henceangle EOG = angle FOG = 40. Therefore answer is 40.	Let's join CE and OF. CE would be equal to CF since CD is diameter and bisects the chord at point G. OE is equal to OF since radius. Now according to the property of chord, angle subtended at the center of the circle is double then the angle subtended on the perimeter. So EOF is double of ECF. Given that angle DCF is 20 degrees therrefore ECF is 40 and EOF will be 80 degrees. Half of 80 is 40 degress which is the angle EOG.  	The diameter CD of circle O crosses the midpoint G of chord EF. Therefore, CD is a perpendicular bisector of triangle EOF and triangle ECF. Thus, angle DCF = angle ECF / 2, and angle EOD = angle EOF / 2. The angle subtended by a chord at the center of a circle is twice the angle subtended by the chord at any point on the circumference of the circle. Therefore, angle EOF = 2 * angle ECF. Substituting angle EOF with 2 * angle EOD and angle ECF with 2 * angle DCF, we get 2 * angle EOD = 4 * angle DCF. Plugging in the value of angle DCF, 2 * angle EOD = 4 * 20. Solving for angle EOD, we get angle EOD = 40. Therefore, angle EOD is equal to 40 degrees.	Since the diameter bisects the chord, it must be perpendicular to the chord. Hence, angle CFG = 180 - 90 - 20 = 70 degrees. Hence, angle COE = 2 * 70 = 140 degrees, since the angle projected by an arc at the center is double of the angle projected by the arc at the circle. Thus, angle EOD = 180 - 140 = 40 degrees.	As diameter CD intersects chord AB at midpoint G we can infer that CD bisects angle EOF and angle ECF. If angle DCF is 20 degree then ECF will be 40 degree. We also know that angles made in the center from a chord is double than that of the angle made at the circumference. So angle EOF is 80 degree. And henceangle EOD is 40 degree. Ans is 40.	In a circle, the angle formed by a diameter and a chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment of the circle. Since ∠DCF is given as 20°, the angle in the alternate segment, which is ∠EOD, is also 20°.  Correct answer: (B) 20°
90	Number of red things = 1 red matte cylinder. Numbre of cylinder = one red matte cylinder + 1 silver shiny cylinder + 1 brown shiny cylinder. Since one red matte cylinder is already included in number of red things, total effective number of things to remove = 1  red matte cylinder + 1 silver shiny cylinder + 1 brown shiny cylinder = 3. In a total of 6 objects, if we remove 3, we are left with 3 objects. Hence answer is 3.	There is 1 red thing. There are 3 cylinders but one of them is red which is already considered. Total number of objects are 6. Therefore subtracting 3 from 6 is equal to 3.	There are 6 objects in the image. There is 1 red thing, which is a tiny cylinder. Subtracting all red things, there are 6 - 1 = 5 objects left. There are 2 other cylinders in the image, one of which is large and gray in color, and the other is large and brown in color. Subtracting all remaining cylinders, there are 5 - 2 = 3 objects left. Therefore, there are 3 objects left.	There is one red thing and two cylinders. There are six objects initially, and removing these three gives us 3 objects.	There is 1 red thing which we subtract in our first subtraction. We then subtract 2 cylinders. So we remove 3 objects. In total we had 6 objects. We are left with 6-3 = 3 objects. Ans is 3	There are six objects in total. Subtracting the red object (1 cylinder) and the other cylinders (2 more), we are left with 3 objects.  Final value: 3.
91	In the given graph, only 2 sequences are below 0 line, which are 2 mandarin followed by english sequences. Hence answer is 2.	A sequence would have a negative influence score when the value is less than 0. From the bar graph plotted, ere are 2 sequences that have negative influence scores.	There are 2 bars that have a value less than 0. Therefore, there are 2 sequences having negative Influence Scores.	As per the given graph, there are 2 sequences which have a negative influence score.	From the plot we can clearly see that there are 2 sequences which have a negative influence. Ans is 2	Based on the bar chart provided, all the sequences have positive Influence Scores as none of the bars extend below the zero line on the y-axis.  0
92		From the given diagram, there seems to be a following trend - The difference of the number on the top and the left bottom is equal to the next triangle's top element. So 6-2=4, 4-1=3 and 3-2=1. Hence 1 is the answer.	The sum of the values on the lower left corners of each of the four triangles is 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 10. Similarly, the sum of the values on the lower right corners of each of the four triangles is 2 + 3 + 5 + 0 = 10. Following the same pattern, the sum of the values of the top corner of each of the four triangles should also equal 10. Thus, 2 + 4 + 3 + ? = 10. For the equation to hold, the missing value ? must be 1. Therefore, the missing value is 1.		In this figure the pattern is as follows, we start with the bottom left 6 and subtract the top which is 2. We get 4 which is now equal to the 2nd triangle's top element. Now we subtract 1 which is in the direction of next triangle. We get 3 which is equal to the top of this triangle. We subtract 2 from it and get 1. Which will be the top element of the last triangle, Ans is 1.	The pattern in the triangles seems to be that the number at the top is the result of subtracting the bottom right number from the bottom left number. For the blue triangle, 6 - 2 = 4, and for the purple triangle, 5 - 2 = 3. Applying the same logic to the black triangle, 1 - 0 = 1.  The missing value is (A) 1.
93						To find the magnitude of the electric field at a radial distance \( r = 2.00 R_2 \) from the center of the configuration, we can use Gauss's law. According to Gauss's law, the electric field \( E \) times the surface area of a Gaussian surface \( A \) is equal to the net charge enclosed \( Q_{\text{enc}} \) divided by the permittivity of free space \( \varepsilon_0 \):  \[ E \cdot A = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\varepsilon_0} \]  At a radial distance \( r = 2.00 R_2 \), the Gaussian surface is outside both the inner rod and the outer shell. Since the outer shell has a charge of \( Q_2 = -2.00 Q_1 \), the net charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface is \( Q_{\text{enc}} = Q_1 + Q_2 = Q_1 - 2.00 Q_1 = -Q_1 \).  However, the electric field outside a conductor is zero, because the charges on the conductor will rearrange themselves such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. This means that the net electric field at \( r = 2.00 R_2 \) due to both the rod and the shell is zero, because the shell's charge cancels out the field from the rod's charge at any
94	Frequency when number of runs = 3 is 14 and frequency when number of runs = 4 is 10. Hence total frequency when number of runs is >2 = 14 plus 10 = 24. hence answer = 24	To count the number of players who have scored more than 2 runs, we need to add the frequency of all the runs scored above 2, therefore the total would be 14+10=24	The scores that are more than 2 runs in the given table are 3 and 4. For 3 runs scored, the frequency is 14. For 4 runs scored, the frequency is 10. Therefore, the number of players who scored more than 2 runs last season is 14 + 10 = 24.	More than 2 runs implies 3 or more runs scored. Looking at the table, we can see that 3 runs were scored 14 times and 4 runs were scored 10 times. Hence, the answer is 24.	In this table to check the players who have scored more than 2 we have entries at 3 and 4 runs. The total frequency of which is 14+10=24. Ans is 24	To find the number of players who scored more than 2 runs last season, we add the frequencies of runs scored that are greater than 2. From the table:  - 3 runs scored by 14 players - 4 runs scored by 10 players  Adding these together: 14 + 10 = 24 players scored more than 2 runs last season.  24
95	Give QC = 5 and Q'C = 15. scale of $Q$ to $Q'$ = ratio of Q'C to QC = 15/5 = 3. Hence answer = 3	Q is such that QC is 5 and Q' is such that Q'C is 15. So using the given scaling with respect to C , we can see that it increased thrice therefore the answer is 3.	The length of CQ is 5, and the length of CQ' is 15. The scale factor from Q to Q' is given by CQ' / CQ = 15 / 5 = 3.	Since QC is 5 and Q'C is 15, we can concluded that the scaling factor should be 15/5 = 3.	Q' is at 15 while Q is at the distance of 5. Therefore we can see the scale to be 3 times. Ans is 3.	The total length from $Q$ to $C$ is 20 units (15 + 5). Since $Q'$ to $Q$ is 5 units, the scale factor is the ratio of $QC$ to $QQ'$, which is \( \frac{20}{5} = 4 \). Therefore, the scale factor from $Q$ to $Q'$ is 4.  (C) 4
96	Range is defined as max value - min value. Max value in the given number of miles = 10 and minimum value = 2. Hence range = 10-2 = 8. Therefore answer = 8.	Range of the numbers is defined as the difference between the maximum number and the minimum number that is to be included in the range determination. So the maximum number of miles equal to 10 which were on Monday and the minimum number of miles were on Tuesday. The difference of this gives the range, which will be 10-2=8	The minimum number of miles in the table is 2, and the maximum number of miles is 10. Thus, the range of the numbers is 10 - 2 = 8.	The range is difference between the minimun and maximum which is 10-2 = 8.	From the table we can gather that the minimum number of miles is 2 and maximum is 10. Range is defined as maximum - minimum. Therefore 10-2 = 8. Ans is 8	To find the range of the numbers, subtract the smallest number from the largest number. The smallest number of miles hiked is 2, and the largest is 10. So, the range is 10 - 2 = 8.
97	In the give image, shape of the graph seems to be downward parabola. Hence if its a prabola, degree of the polynomial would be 2. Hence asnwer = 2.	A degree is defined as the greatest exponent of the equation or most number of solutions a function can have or graphically how many times a curve crosses x axis. In the given graph, the curve crosses the x axis twice and hence degree is 2. 	The function has only one point where the gradient is 0, with the gradient continuously increasing in magnitude in both directions from this point. Therefore, the degree of this function is 2.	The given function looks like a quadratic function hence its degree must be 2.	The degree of a polynomial is defined by the number of zeros it has or the number of times it touches the x axis. From the figure we can see that the function touches the x axis 2 times. Therefore it's a 2  degree-polynomial. Ans is 2.	The graph represents a parabola, which is the graph of a quadratic function. A quadratic function has a degree of 2.  2
98	Number of large red rubber blocks = 0. Number of tiny red matte objects = 1 red cube. In a total of 3 objects, if we remove one object, we are left with 2 objects. hence answer = 2.	There is 1 large red rubber block. There are 0 tiny red matte object. Total number of objects are 3. Therefore subtracting 1 from 3 is equal to 2.	There are 3 objects in the image. There are 0 large red rubber blocks. Subtracting all large red rubber blocks, there are still 3 objects left. There is 1 tiny red matte object, which is a cube. Subtracting all tiny red matte objects, there are 3 - 1 = 2 objects left. Therefore, there are 2 objects left.	There are zero large rubber blocks and one tiny red matte object. There are three objects initially, and removing this gives us 2 objects.	There are no large red rubber blocks so we don't subtract anything in our first subtraction. We then subtract a tiny red matte object. So we remove 1 objects. In total we had 3 objects. We are left with 3-1 = 2 objects. Ans is 2	There are three objects in total. Subtracting the large red rubber block and the tiny red matte object, which are both red, leaves one object that is neither large and red nor tiny and red.   1
99	Given Angle O is 110. Since ABCD is inscribed in the circle, Angle A is half of the angle O. Hence angle A = 110/2 = 55. ans sum of angles A and C = 180 since ABCD is a cyclic quadrialteral. Therefore, angle C = 180-angle A = 180-55 = 125. Hence answer = 125.	In th egiven figure, DB is the chord of the circle and angle BOD and BAD angles subtended via chord DB. Therefore, BOD will be double of angle BAD. Angle BOD is 110 degrees making angle BAD 55 degrees. Since quadrilateral ABCD is circumscribed in the circle opposite interior angles sum to 180 degrees. Therefore, angle C is equal to 180-55=125 degrees. 	The angle subtended by a chord at the center of a circle is double the angle subtended by the chord at a point on the circumference. Therefore, angle O = 2 * angle A. Plugging in the value of angle O, 110 = 2 * angle A. Which implies, angle A = 55 degrees. Since quadrilateral ABCD is inscribed in circle O, using the Inscribed Quadrilateral Theorem, we get angle A + angle C = 180. Plugging in the value for angle A computed earlier, 55 + angle C = 180. Which implies, angle C = 125 degrees. Therefore the degree of angle C is 125 degrees.	Since angle O is 110 degrees, angle A must be 55 degrees since they are both projected by arc DB. Since ABCD is inscribed in a circle, its opposite angles must sum up to 180 degrees. Thus angle C = 180 - 55 = 125 degrees.	Angle made by a chord in the center is double of that of the angle made by the chord in the circumference. So by that logic we can see that angle A is half of angle O as they are both angles made by chord DB. So therefore angle A is 110/2 = 55 degree. Now if a quadilateral is circumscribed in a circle then the opposite angles of that quadilateral sums up to 180. Therefore angle C + angle A = 180. Angle A is 180 - 55 = 125 degree. Ans is 125	The angle at the center of a circle is twice the angle at the circumference when both angles stand on the same arc. Therefore, if ∠O is 110°, then the angle at the circumference (∠C) standing on the same arc would be half of that, which is 55°. However, this option is not listed, so it seems there might be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the given information or the question might be incorrect as stated.  If we consider that ∠O is the angle subtended by arc DC at the center, then ∠C would indeed be half of ∠O, which is not among the provided choices. Please double-check the question or provide additional context for accurate assistance.
