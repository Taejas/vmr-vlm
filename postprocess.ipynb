Therefore, angle O = 2 * angle A. Plugging in the value of angle O, 110 = 2 * angle A. Which implies, angle A = 55 degrees. Since quadrilateral ABCD is inscribed in circle O, using the Inscribed Quadrilateral Theorem, we get angle A + angle C = 180. Plugging in the value for angle A computed earlier, 55 + angle C = 180. Which implies, angle C = 125 degrees. Therefore the degree of angle C is 125 degrees.   \n",

Therefore, if ∠O is 110°, then the angle at the circumference (∠C) standing on the same arc would be half of that, which is 55°. However, this option is not listed, so it seems there might be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the given information or the question might be incorrect as stated.  If we consider that ∠O is the angle subtended by arc DC at the center, then ∠C would indeed be half of ∠O, which is not among the provided choices.

In this situtaion the kinectic energy gets converetd to potential energy hence we can equate 1/2*k*(x^2) with 1/2*m*(v^2). Given mass(m)=400 gms, spring constant(k)=750 and velocity(v)=0.5m/s, the distance(x) the spring moved is 1.2 m.\n",

Thus, (1/2) * m * v^2 = (1/2) * k * d^2. Given m = 0.40 kg, v = 0.5 m/s, k = 750 N/m. Plugging in the known values, (1/2) * 400 * 0.5^2 = (1/2) * 750 * d^2. Simplifying the equation, we get d = 0.011547 m = 1.1547 cm. Rounding off the answer to one decimal place, we get d = 1.2 cm. Thus, the spring is compressed by a distance of 1.2.\n",

       "99                        The angle subtended by a chord at the center of a circle is double the angle subtended by the chord at a point on the circumference. Therefore, angle O = 2 * angle A. Plugging in the value of angle O, 110 = 2 * angle A. Which implies, angle A = 55 degrees. Since quadrilateral ABCD is inscribed in circle O, using the Inscribed Quadrilateral Theorem, we get angle A + angle C = 180. Plugging in the value for angle A computed earlier, 55 + angle C = 180. Which implies, angle C = 125 degrees. Therefore the degree of angle C is 125 degrees.   \n",

The block will be stopped when the Kinetic Energy of the block is equal to the Potential Energy of the spring.

       "99  Angle made by a chord in the center is double of that of the angle made by the chord in the circumference. So by that logic we can see that angle A is half of angle O as they are both angles made by chord DB. So therefore angle A is 110/2 = 55 degree. Now if a quadilateral is circumscribed in a circle then the opposite angles of that quadilateral sums up to 180. Therefore angle C + angle A = 180. Angle A is 180 - 55 = 125 degree. Ans is 125   \n",
